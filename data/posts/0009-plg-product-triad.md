In a PLG company, the product is at the very center of everything, with the user being the center of the product. Lean
management fits extremely well with the PLG business model. Lean management looks to maximize value delivery to the user
while minimizing waste.

Every department, team, and individual shares the same goal of improving the product and is aligned with the lean
management priciples. And each one of these entities brings a unique and important perspective in this alignment and
plays a specific role in the makeup of the organization.


## The Core Product Groups

Product owns and is responsible for the value that is delivered to the end user through the product. They are the
collection point for all end user feedback. Their main responsibility is to collect all of this feedback, synthesize it
to problem definition. They also lead the plan on what metrics need to be collected to verify the problem and measure the
value to rank it against other problem definitions. These metrics include the supporting metrics for financial gain. No
product decision, whether it leads to financial growth or not, is made without the data in support.


Design owns and is responsible for designing the solution to a defined problem from Product that is deemed the highest
value delivery to end users. They develop and design solutions and alternatives and run user research on them to
validate their designs. If the solution is a large functionality change, the user research should be done previous to
the solution being implemented in the product. However, if the solution is not a large change, the user research should
come from in-product and be supported by the user feedback loop to Product. If A/B testing is applicable, it would be
used here to enable in-product user feedback. Secondarily, Design uses their user experience expertise to help support
Product with user data by providing user research to help measure and analyze product in support of defining user
problems and prioritizing the defined problems. 

The primary responsibility of Engineering Development is to implement the solution that Design has developed. Their
secondary responsibility is to use their technical expertise to support Design with technical review of solutions and
alternatives to defined user problems. Design leans heavily on Engineering for the feasibility and complexity of a
solution. Engineering is responsible for providing feedback to assist with minimizing technical complexity to contribute
to the overall Lean goals of maximizing value delivery while minimizing waste. Complexity is the enemy of Lean since it
causes friction in fast delivery of value by being slow to develop and test. Complexity is also risk prone to rework
which increases waste. 

If the organization's engineering practices support a culture of experimentation and iteration, one of the important
user data collection streams is in-product. Increasing the velocity of delivering a minimum valuable product into the
hands of the users to gain feedback enables higher velocity of value learning. The primary business goal of a product is
to delight and deliver value to the users. Feedback on already-delivered product capabilities leads to faster refinement
of what is valuable to the end user: what is worth investing in and what is not. This is the secret to leading the
marketplace.

The organization structure should be such that it promotes PLG and lean management. The lean management principles
should be applied to the communication channel creation as well: maximize the delivery of value in communication while
minimizing waste of uneeded communication. Organization communication is the hardest problems to solve.

In PLG organizations, the Core product groups each have a complimentray roles and responsibilities to play in order to
be the most effective. Each business function relies heavily on each other to make up the whole of the core product 
group to optimize the Lean management goals: maximizing value delivery to the end user and minimizing waste.
