I am observing a growing communication pattern in remote communication culture that is a cause for great concern.
Information is not flowing evenly throughout the organization; both in timing and source of information. Organizational
communication is the hardest problem to solve. In the past few years with the rise in remote work, the patterns that we
have become used to have been flipped on their heads and might not be effective anymore.

Timing by itself is not the issue. As the world has started to adopt a more distributed work culture, communication has
become more asynchronous. This means that information does not flow through the organization at the same rate. A CEO
might send out an email, but every employee might read it at slightly different times. All company meetings are an
example of when all of the employees receive information at the same time (synchronous communication). With either of
these communication strategies in a traditional in-office company, all of the employees would eventually receive the
information. One employee who doesn't read their emails might hear the information from another employee, but most
likely in the form of "Have you read the latest All Company email?" which essentially quotes the source of the
information.

As our workforces get more distributed across different timezones, sometimes with timezones that have little to no
overlap, the use of asynchronous communication techniques has drastically risen. This increase in asynchronous
communication has caused a need in any synchronous communication to first level-set and make sure everyone is caught up
before proceeding with the agenda. This level-setting has led to what I am calling the _Triangles of Death_. If I
received information in a meeting that someone else was not in, and I share my interpretation of what was shared, there
is a high likelihood that the people that I am sharing it with will want to confirm it in some way. Without an email or
notes to point back to for that decision, they have to go get that information the original person and this starts the
triangle. There might be more conversation, perspective or decisions discussed in that chat and that doesn't get back to
the original meeting. This is the start of the _Triangle of Death_. 

_Triangles of Death_ become more prominent when there is a lack of transparent communication. If information makes
a lot of stops through the social network before getting to the end goal, the information takes a lot longer to get to
the destination and there is a lot more room for translation errors. Everyone that touches the information as it passes
has the opportunity to change it in some way, sometimes unconsciously. This timing and source issue 

_Triangles of Death_ also become more prominent when there is a lack of organizational alignment on the company's Golden
Circle (the WHY, HOW, WHAT of the organization [[1](https://simonsinek.com/golden-circle/)]) or even a lack of having a
Golden Circle to align on. Without alignment, everyone in the company is doing what they think is the best thing
for the company from the goals and mission that they understand. And these undirected constantly get in the way of
others which creates a lack of trust that people around you understand the goals and how the organization is getting
there.

It seems that the lack of trust is the common denominator of _Triangles of Death_. And the kicker is that being in a
_Triangle of Death_ grows the lack of trust. Any system that grows itself is a compounding growth system and has the
capability of exponential growth. Exponential growth of _lack of trust_ is not a system that we want to see grow
exponentially. _"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. [They] who understand it, earns it...[they] who
doesn't...pays it"_ [[2](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he)].


## Some things to experiment with to improve

*Intentionally design and iterate on organization communication guidelines* with a focus on async first. Organization
communication is a necessary process in any organization. Left on its own, it will evolve as everyone sees fit which
will most likely get chaotic as the company changes.

*Use transparent communication channels first, only reserving DMs for personal, private, or sensitive information*.
Using public communication channels helps share information out to the rest of the team, department, or organization.
There is a risk of information overload, but the guidelines in the above point should be able to help. 
GitHub Engineering [3](https://github.com/github/how-engineering-communicates) has a great example of how they create
guidelines, expectations, and channel definitions. 

*Realize that effective communication takes time* and that time will not be spent on product development. A lot of
perspective on product or feature development take on the idea of maximizing feature development because more features
means more value to the end user. While we might not be able to put out the theoretical maximum value for this cycle,
sprint, or quarter, focusing on investing the time to improve communication processes and systems will result in a
better employee engagement which will sustain the organization through even the toughest of economical times.

*Cultivate awareness of _Triangles of Death_* so that we can all strive towards avoiding them at all costs.
