There is a growing communication pattern in remote communication culture that is a cause for great concern. In some
organizations, information is not flowing evenly throughout; both in timing and source of information. This isn't
necessarily a huge surprise since organizational communication is one of the hardest problem to solve.
The patterns that we have become used to over the decades have been flipped on their heads and might
not be effective anymore.

Communication has become more asynchronous as the world has started to adopt a more distributed work culture. As a
result, information does not flow through the organization at the same rate. Every employee might read an email from the
CEO at different times even thought she sent it out to everyone at the same time. All-Company meetings are an example of
synchronous communication when all of the employees receive information at the same time. But these are not new
communication patterns resulting from a globally distributed work force. When used in at an in-office company, all of
the employees would eventually receive the information and this happened relatively quickly. Employees might ask "Have
you read the latest All Company email?" which essentially quotes the source of the information. But it is not the rise
in asynchronous communication that is causing concern.

As our workforces get more distributed across different timezones, sometimes with timezones that have little to no
overlap, the use of asynchronous communication techniques has drastically risen. The increase in asynchronous
communication has caused the need to first level-set when attending to synchronous communication and make sure everyone
is caught up before proceeding with the agenda. This level-setting has led to what I am call the _Triangles of Death_.
If I share a high impact piece of information that was given in a meeting with someone that missed that meeting, there
is a high likelihood that they will want to confirm the others in the meeting. Without an email or notes to point back
to for that decision, they have to go get that information the original person and this starts the triangle. There might
be more conversation, perspective or decisions discussed in that chat and that doesn't get back to the original meeting.
This is the start of the _Triangle of Death_. 

_Triangles of Death_ become more prominent when there is a lack of transparent communication in the organization as a
part or a whol$. If information has passed through many people of the organization network before getting to someone,
the information takes a lot longer to get to the destination and there is a lot more room for translation errors.
Everyone that touches the information as it passes has the opportunity to change it in some way, sometimes
unconsciously. This is a source issue that is aggravated by timing.

_Triangles of Death_ also become more prominent when there is a lack of organizational alignment on the company's Golden
Circle (the WHY, HOW, WHAT of the organization [[1](https://simonsinek.com/golden-circle/)]) or even a lack of having a
Golden Circle to align on. Without alignment, everyone in the company is doing what they think is the best thing for the
company from their perspective of the goals and mission. And these differing directions constantly get in the way of
other's directions which creates a lack of trust that people around you understand the goals and how the organization is
getting there.

It seems that the lack of trust is the common denominator of _Triangles of Death_. And the scary bit is that being in a
_Triangle of Death_ continues to grow the lack of trust in the organization. Any system that grows itself is a
compounding growth system and has the capability of exponential growth. Exponential growth of _lack of trust_ is not a
system that we want to see grow exponentially. _"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. [They] who
understand it, earns it...[they] who doesn't...pays it"_

## Some things to experiment with to improve

*Intentionally design and iterate on organization communication guidelines* with a focus on asynchronous communication
first. Organization communication is a necessary process in any organization. Left on its own, it will evolve as
everyone sees fit which will leads a high risk of becoming chaotic as the company changes.

*Use transparent communication channels first, only reserving DMs for personal, private, or sensitive information*.
Using public communication channels helps share information out to the rest of the team, department, or organization.
There is a risk of information overload, but it should be mitigated with an intentional design from the above point.
GitHub Engineering [3](https://github.com/github/how-engineering-communicates) has a great example of how they create
guidelines, expectations, and channel definitions. 

*Realize that effective communication takes time* and that time will not be spent on product development. A lot of
perspective on product or feature development take on the idea of maximizing feature development because more features
means more value to the end user. While we might not be able to put out the theoretical maximum value for this cycle,
sprint, or quarter, focusing on investing the time to improve communication processes and systems will result in a
better employee engagement which will sustain the organization through even the toughest of economical times, delivering
more value over time.

*Cultivate awareness of _Triangles of Death_* so that we can all strive towards avoiding them at all costs.
