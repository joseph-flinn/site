I have recently been a part of the hiring process for my new manager. We're adding a level of middle manager as the
company grows. One of the questions that we asked the candidates is: _What is the difference between being a manager and
being a leader?_ We have gotten some surprising responses out of a relatively low sample size.

There was general agreement that management skills focus on the tactical day-to-day tasks. The majority of the candidates
had an overall negativity to the word _management_. "If done wrong, it looks like _do this, do it this way, and do it
now_." came up more than once almost word for word. However, the candidates didn't go on to offer what management was
when done right.

Leadership, on the other hand, had an overtone of coaching and mentoring, with the more long term strategy in mind.
Leaders coach and mentor.

I will admit, when talking about abstract ideas like _management_ and _leadership_, it can be really challenging. Are
they on the same continuum? Are they on different continuums but somehow related? Managers are put into Leadership
positions, so it seems like they have to be related.

As a child, I was fascinated with medieval history and high fantasy and the battles that would take place. Growing up
and watching battles in movies, I saw two types of leaders: one that would lead the charge into battle from the front
and one that would stay at the very back surrounded by their retinue. Even though the battles and leaders were
fictional, I could tell that the armies that followed their kings, queens, or generals into battle were the ones that
fought harder and for a purpose rather than feeling like being led to slaughter. My respect for character's leadership
was determined with the part they played in the battle, whether they were at the front or the back.

Leaders are the first into the fray and the first into the unknown. They lead the charge and people follow because they
trust them. They trust that the leader has the group's best interest in mind. They know that the leader might make a
mistake, but they wouldn't sacrifice the members of the group; especially not for personal gain. Leaders create a
purpose for the group and build the trust needed to work towards that purpose. Leaders provide protection for the
group. 

Leaders pull up other leaders around them. And great leaders will sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the
group before they would sacrifice any one of their group members. They know that there is someone to step up into their
place because they have pulled them up as a leader.

Everyone is a leader, no matter their position in the group. Group cohesion is up to every member of the group. The
group leader is not always present in every activity. When there is a singular purpose and everyone is moving towards
it, every member is given the great responsibility of not going rogue. 

Managers are leaders. Management skills are the subset of Leadership skills that build the trust with the team.
Management skills are the ones that are used to Actively Listen to team members when they have concerned with the
direction to achieve goals for the group's purpose. Actively listening allows people's ideas and perspectives to be
heard. They feel understood. The group goals might change and they might not. But when someone feels truly heard AND
understood, they are much more likely to not go rogue and leave the group. When their perspectives contribute to the
group direction towards the purpose, it builds strong and lasting cohesion in the group. 

In short, Leaders align groups on a greater purpose, provide protection, and are the _first_ into danger and the
unknown. Managers set behavior expectations of what it means to be a member of the group and delivers supportive
feedback on how to improve as a member. Managers are Leaders and so is every other member of the group.
