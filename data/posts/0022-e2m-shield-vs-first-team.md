I was introduced to the idea of First Team by Patrick Lencioni last year as I was assisting with conducting interviews
for my new manager [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjE_mPoZPSg)]. The general idea of First Team is prioritizing
the alignment of the team of peers over representing and lobbying for team the leader is leading.  While Lencioni
focuses the idea of the First Team on the Executive Leadership team, it can and should be applied throughout the
organization at all levels. As an engineering manager, I have two teams: the team of other engineering manager peers and
the team that I lead.

I have recently been reading a lot of Simon Sinek with books like _Leaders Eat Last_
[[2](https://simonsinek.com/books/leaders-eat-last/)] and _The Infinite Game_
[[3](https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/)]. _Leaders Eat Last_ has done a lot in shaping how I see
leadership. Sinek's main thoughts around what makes great leaders are leaders that care for, protect and provide for 
their teams. He uses the biology of the wolf pack as an example. Alpha wolves care for, protect, and provide for the
rest of the pack (I wrote a [post on Leadership](./posts/e2m-management-and-leadership) in more depth last week). The
more a leader cares for, protects, and provide for their team, the more tight knit their team will operate. If each team
member knows that the leader is leading for the good of the team and will not sacrifice the members for self gain, the
more the team will pull together and sacrifice for each other.

These two ideas seem at odds, and a quick search on the internet for "shit shield" brings up a lot of posts written
about management and middle management from both the "managers should be shit shields" and "managers shouldn't be shit
shields" perspectives. I've given it a lot over the last year and, like most important things in life, have concluded
that it is a lot more nuanced than than the one dimensional "do this" and "don't do this". There is a missing piece, and
that piece is _Trust_.

It seems like Lencioni's call to action is the action or behavior of prioritizing the First Team over the Second Team.
Taken from the Systems Thinking perspective, prioritization of teams is presented as an input into the system to fix
team dynamics and organizational alignment. However, I see a slight issue with First Team being an action or a system
input. As modeled, First Team being an action assumes that the more prioritization the First Team gets, the less issues
the organization is going to have. The First Team idea is really important, but I think it is more important as an
indicator for organizational health (output) rather than the action to improve it (input). When an organization is
healthy, the First Team is pulling together and sacrificing for each other. If this sounds like a Second Team from
Sinek's work, that would be correct. Every First Team is also a Second Team with a leader who has a different First
Team.

Similarly, shielding is less of an action and more of an outcome; an indicator of organizational health similar to the
First Team. But the indicator is not whether shielding exists or not, it is where the shield wall is. Following Sinek's
terminology [[2](https://simonsinek.com/books/leaders-eat-last/)], shielding is the boundary of the Circle of Safety.
The indicator for organizational health is where the boundary is. If the only shield wall that exists in an organization is at
the boundary between the organization and the rest of the world or market, that indicates a healthy organization;
everyone is inside the same Circle of Safety. However, if shields are appearing inside of the company, that means there
are internal threats that are being defended against. And internal threats are the single largest threat to the survival
of an organization.

So if prioritization and the act of shielding aren't inputs to change organizational health, what is? What do both of
these have in common? _Trust_. The more _Trust_ in an organization, the more aligned that organization will be across
all First Teams. The more alignment in an organization, the less internal shielding is necessary to maintain _Trust_
inside of each Second Team. How do you build _Trust_? Put both your First Team and Second Team before your needs and
desires. Never sacrifice team members for self gain. Be the first into the Unknown. Be a
[Leader](./posts/e2m-management-and-leadership)
