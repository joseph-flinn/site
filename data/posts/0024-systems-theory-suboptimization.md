!! description: Discussing Will Larson's Value Oasis in the context of Systems Theory

---

I was recently talking with a Director of a Foundations Engineering group which contained the Platform, SRE, and Data
teams. We got to talking about what leads to dysfunction in an organization. [My recent thoughts built from Simon Sinek's
perspective on leadership](./posts/e2m-management-and-leadership) really drove my perspective in the conversation. I
briefly discussed my thoughts on the tension between 
[shielding and Patrick Lencioni's idea of "First Team"](./posts/e2m-shield-vs-first-team). From my interpretation, the
Director's point of view was built mostly from Patrick Lencioni's idea of the "First Team". As we discussed some of the
alignment issues at my current organization and how it was affecting my team, my conversational counterpart mentioned
that he thought I'd really like Will Larson's thoughts on Value Oases (today I learned the plural of oasis). 

After the conversation, I went and looked up Larson's post on [Value Oases](https://lethain.com/values-oasis/) and found
that the thesis is that these are created when there is misalignment between the values of the team and the values of
the organization. This misalignment comes from a leader applying the wrong technique to influence without authority.
Larson touches briefly on enacting changes inside of your authority to model to those outside to influence their
direction. However, there are two different instances where this might be applied: ambiguity or disagreement. Larson
explains that when there is ambiguity, this approach is a great way to influence. However, if this is used when there is
already a process in place by you disagree with it, this is where the value divergence comes from. And it is here where
a Value Oasis is created.


If a Value Oasis is defined as a misalignment of values between a team's values and an organization's values, a team's
values shifting away from the organization values isn't the only way to cause drift. The other that Larson doesn't
explicitly explore is the organization values shifting and the team values not shifting with the organization. To
determine if this misalignment caused by shifting values is good or bad is an ethical conversation based on the values
themselves and as such are outside of the scope of the conversation. The end is the same though: misalignment.

I want to explore Value Oases a bit more, but first, some historical context.

Through management coaching (and just growing up as a human), I have come to realize and appreciate how important
diverse perspectives are for solving problems. The transition from individual contributor (IC) success to success as a
people manager felt a lot more natural than I was expecting. I went from a very competitive mindset and communication
style to a supportive one. Overnight, my success criteria went from implementing elegant and resilient solutions to
solve technical problems to my success being my team's success. And in those first two weeks, my beliefs in the value of
perspective was put to the test in addition to the opportunity to add or remove trust from this new position (as the
topic of this post is not on building trust or the value of perspectives, [this post](./posts/e2m-marbles)
goes into more details).

Somewhere in my childhood or adolescence I developed an ego problem. I first became aware of it in university where I
caught myself thinking that I was smarter than most of my computer science professors. There are quite a few things
wrong with the phrase "was smarter", but the theories of intelligence in psychology is a topic for another post.
Breaking the number one rule of studying psychology--do not psycho-analyze yourself--there are two main sources that I
believe led to the building of this ego. The first is praise for "being smart" instead of praise for the behavior that
led to the specific outcome
[2](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en). The second is a
particular way of "seeing the big picture" in a way that people around me couldn't see. Together, these worked in a
vicious loop to build that ego. 

After I matured as a human and had built better control of my ego through the theory of multiple intelligences
[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences) and seeing how diverse perspectives could solve
issues in more creative and robust ways, I started searching for why I was different. This search wasn't to bolster my
ego, it was to find the why so that I could then translate what I was seeing to language that someone else could see and
understand. Having a great idea or having a great perspective but not having the skills to translate and communicate it
is what Jocko Willink and Leif Babin call a "tortured genius" [4](https://echelonfront.com/books/extreme-ownership/). It
doesn't matter how good the idea is or how big of an impact it will have, if a group of people cannot be organized
around it because they don't understand it, the idea will not take off.

Last year in my search I stumbled upon a book that I think contains the answer: _Thinking in Systems_ by Donella H.
Meadows [5](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/). The skill of abstracting and simplifying the
world into stocks, flows, and feedback loops is the mindset that I use to perceive the world. I have been doing this
without the training in Systems Theory; stumbling my way through without the correct terms or shared jargon. I could see
the abstract ideas, but could only communicate through allegory and description because I did not know the name of the
idea.

In the studies of Systems Theory, a system is defined as: "a set of elements or parts that is coherently organized and
interconnected in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviors, often classified as its
_function_ or _purpose_". The elements of most real-world systems are other subsystems. The human body is made up of
organs which are made up of cells which is made up of DNA. An organization is made up of teams which are made up of
individuals. 

Another idea is Systems Theory to be aware of in a conversation about Systems Theory is a specific type of system called
a hierarchy. A _hierarchy_ is created when a system _self-organizes_ (another idea in Systems Theory) to continue
towards its _purpose_ or _function_. Hierarchies evolve from the lowest level up with the purpose to help its
originating subsystems do their jobs better.

Let's take a look at a technology startup as an example. Most startups start with just a few people with an idea for a
solution to a problem that other people need solved. Let's say for instance that the founding two members are
technologists and they build the solution themselves. As the idea is implemented and pushed out into the world, the
world loves it and demands more. As the demand for the product grows, so does the demand for time devoted to marketing
to drive more demand, sales to help deliver that demand, customer success for people who are having issues, design for
new features, engineering to build those features and scale the original solution. Eventually, the original "system" of
two technologists is exceeded and company is required to create teams--or subsystems--and increase head count. The
system just _self-organized_ and created a _hierarchy_ to continue to enable the specific jobs needed to put the
solution out into the world.

And the final idea from Systems Theory that I'll be referencing in the discussion on Value Oases is _suboptimization_.
_Suboptimization_ in a system is when a subsystem's goals dominate at the expense of the total system's goals.

A Value Oasis in an organization is a _suboptimization_ of a team's values or goals in an organization. But the opposite
side of the coin is the hierarchy forgetting that their _purpose_ is to help the subsystems do their jobs better. 
Having or using too much central control to set the goals for a subsystem causes the hierarchy to malfunction. 

From a Systems Theory perspective, there are two reasons why an organization is dysfunctional: 1) optimization of team
goals over the organization goals, and 2) the hierarchy of the organization forgetting its original purpose to help the
subsystems do their jobs better. Systems in the real world are messy, so it isn't either/or. It is a mixture of both.
And it true Systems Theory fashion, is there a causation between the both reasons? Are there feedback loops in the
system? And if so, are they reinforcing or balancing feedback loops? How do we dampen the oscillations in a
dysfunctional organization to converge to a sustainable long term future instead of leading to a self-induced
extinction?
