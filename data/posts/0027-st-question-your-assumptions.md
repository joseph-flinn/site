Training dogs holds a very special place in my heart. There is very little that brings me more satisfaction and joy than
to work with and train an intelligent canine. I have found that consistency, almost to an extreme, is the key of
developing and maintaining desired behavior. 

The traditional learning loop that is proposed and studied extensively in psychology for learning for both animals and
humans is single-loop learning. An agent is placed into a world, receives feedback information, makes a decision,
experiences the feedback from the decision, receives more feedback to make another decision. And so on and so forth _ad
infinitum_.

> Single-loop learning does not result in deep change to our mental models--our understanding of the casual structure of
> the system, along with the boundary of the model (which variables are included and which are excluded) and the time
> horizon we consider relevant--our framing or articulation of a problem (Sterman, 2000)

The famous Skinner Box experiments shows this well. A rat is placed into a box that has at least one lever connected to
some feedback. Depending on the research question, the lever could deliver different types of feedback: positive
reinforcement, positive punishment, negative reinforcement, and negative punishment. The overall idea of the Skinner Box
is to test different operant conditioning research questions in isolated and controlled environments (Nickerson, 2024).
After a few times in the box, rats show the behavior of running over and immediately pressing the lever. From a
single-loop learning perspective, the box is the world and throughout the experiment stays constant. The rat is the
agent. The agent presses a lever and receives feedback and quickly builds a mental model of how the world works. The
world is held constant, feedback is delivered, decisions are made and behavior is formed and executed with continued
experimentation.

> We are taught from an early age that every event has a cause, which in turn is an effect of some still earlier cause:
> "Inventory is too high because sales unexpectedly fell. Sales fell because the competitors lowered their price. The
> competitors lowered their prices because ..." Such event-level explanations can be extended indefinitely, in an
> unbroken Aristotelian chain of cause and effects, until we arrive at some First Cause, or more likely, lose interest
> along they way (Sterman, 2000).

In a different Skinner Box experiment, Skinner experimented with food delivery regular interval food delivery with
pigeons and found that the pigeons associated whatever behavior they were doing right before the food delivery with the
appearance of food (Skinner, 1948). A cause-effect relationship was formed between behavior and reward even though there
was no relation between the cause and effect. Anthropomorphically, the pigeons assumed that it was from the event of
their behavior that caused the event of the food appearance and formed a superstition. A mental model was formed of the
world that it was their behavior that caused the food to appear. However, when the regular interval of the food delivery
was stopped, it was observed that the pigeon's learned "superstitious" behavior deteriorated. When the regular food
delivery started back up, a completely new behavior was "learned" at the same rate as before.

Single-loop learning assumes that the world is constant and not changing. The Skinner Box doesn't change...until it
does. In the pigeon experiment, the world doesn't stay constant as it did the experiment with the rats. The period of
the appearance of food changes and so does the observed behavior of the pigeon's mental model. From the anthropomorphic
perspective of the pigeon, the pigeon receives positive reinforcement feedback for a certain behavior when the food
appears--even though there is no relation--so it decides to keep doing that behavior. The feedback from the system
continues. When the feedback stops--the regular intervals of food delivery stops--the behavior continues but
deteriorates over time as the perceived feedback stops. The feedback that indicates that it is not the behavior that
causes the food updates the pigeon's mental model in relation. When the regular interval food delivery is resumed,
a new cause-effect relationship starts, even though the delivery is still not related to the behavior. In the studied
cases, a new cause-effect "superstitious" behavior was observed (Skinner, 1948). 

In double-loop learning, the feedback doesn't just affect the decisions in the world. Feedback also updates the mental
models, decision rules, decision making strategies, and the system itself (Sterman, 2000). The resulting behavior from
the system is different than before because the system is different than before.

> Systems Thinking is double-loop learning: information feedback about the real world no only alters our decisions
> within the context of the exiting frames and decision rules, but also feeds back to alter our mental models. As our
> mental models change, we change the structure of our systems, creating different decision rules and strategies. The
> same information processed by different decision rules and strategies now yield a different decision (Sterman, 2000).

There is are lists of things that impede learning at each point in double-loop learning: the real world is very complex
and difficult to reason about with accuracy, selective perception, biases, ambiguity, misperceptions of feedback,
unscientific reasoning (even by scientists), judgemental biases, defensive routines, inconsistent decision making, and
performance as goal are just some. These all have something in common: a strong underlying bias that currently held
assumptions are more accurate that something else, even in the face of disconfirming evidence of the held assumptions.

Identifying and questioning all assumptions is paramount to learning in complex systems. As we try to work towards a
specific system goal, have we defined the boundaries well enough? Is there a variable that we have intentionally or
unintentionally not included in the model that has a large effect on the behavior of the larger system? What is the
stated goal of the system that we are studying? Does the behavior of the system move towards that goal, or is there a
goal that it is moving towards in action that is different than the stated goal? 

When we start questioning all of our assumptions, we allow flexibility in our mental models to conform to the observed
world instead of demanding the world conform to our mental models. Our perspectives shifts. It becomes easier to relate
to other humans because our mental models of the world remain fluid.
