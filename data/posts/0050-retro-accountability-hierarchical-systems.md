!! description: Discussing my latest thoughts around accountability in reflection of my amygdala hijacking response

---

Over the last decade, I have observed in myself that I have a close-to-physical response of
revulsion to the word "accountability". The word "accountability" and associated idea has grown
exponentially since the 1960s.

I don't quite know where the response comes from which seems to point to it being an emotional
response since it is not based in a conscious decision. I want to understand what is leading to the
response and to bring the subconscious thoughts into the conscious. The best way I know how to do
this is to take the nonlinear cloud of thought and order them linearly on a page. Herick Karlsson
has an outstanding piece on this idea (Karlsson 2023).

Let's start with some background. I was raised to value responsibility and honor. When I make a
mistake, I have the opportunity to be honorable and take responsibility for the mistake. To choose
not to take responsibility is to be dishonest and therefore dishonorable. As a manager and leader, I
believe that responsibility for failures stops at the leader (Willink 2015). Great leaders take
responsibility for the mistakes of their team; the failures are the leader's but the wins are their
team’s (Sinek 2017).

In addition to responsibility and honor, I strongly believe in having a growth mindset (Dweck 2008).
[Past success does not predict future success](./posts/retro-success-does-not-predict-sucess). If
past success does not predict future success, there are few lessons to learn from past success. If
one cannot learn from success, then learning failure is the only other option. 

How might accountability fit? It seems to me that accountability should fit nicely. Accountability,
as it is often described, should help me live up to my seemingly rigid beliefs of responsibility and
honor. So why do I have such a strong reaction to it?

Accountability is an externally applied framework to some account in a social system. All social
systems develop hierarchies (Koski 2015). Let's define the decisions, actions, and inactions of an
individual in a social system as their behavior. In the social system of an organization the account
that is often used in accountability practices is the list of an individual's behavior. By
definition, accountability can only have a single owner. 

The accountability feedback loop in a system only activates in failure. There is no such thing as
holding someone accountable for a success. When a failure happens, and an accountability feedback
loop exists in the system, it is activated and the owner of that specific account is blamed and held
responsible for the failure.

Systems thinking shows that the decisions, actions, and inactions that an individual makes in a
system is the summation of the goals, incentives, and pressures on the role that the individual has
rather than from a characteristic of the individual themselves. This is known as bounded rationality
(Meadows 2008). 

System outcomes are directly correlated by the behavior of the system. If they are not the desired
outcomes, the behavior of the system needs to be adjusted. Adjustments in decision making policies
change the behavior which in turn changes the outcome. This is known academically as double-loop
learning, where the outcomes from the system feeds back into the system to adjust the decision
policies (Sterman 2009). However, the adjustments to the decision making process must be an
adjustment to the variables of bounded rationality--system goals, incentives, and pressures--or the
output will not change. 

Until last week--when I started practicing thinking in writing for this specific topic of
accountability--I would have defended the idea that there is no room for accountability in a healthy
social system. There are definitely behaviors that are detrimental to the system and should be
corrected, but there are other tools and feedback loops to use that are more effective at behavior
change. Effective feedback and clear expectations go a long way to adjusting behavior, but this is a
topic for a different post. 

When I think of the word accountability, my past experiences have led me to picture a hierarchical
social structure where accountability is pushed down the system; those with hierarchical power are
holding those with less power accountable for the outcomes of behavior. The idea of accountability
is often presented in conjunction with the belief that the person being held accountable for the
outcome has the power and authority to change and affect the outcome. Any other belief would go
against our ideas of justice and what is fair. This emotion is often drawn on in cinema to solidify
a villainous character, often to hold their right-hand person responsible for some outcome that they
don't have the power to guarantee.

This top-down direction flow of accountability is only one of the two possible directions through a
hierarchical system. There is another, rarer direction of bottom-up. Bottom-up accountability has a
similar gravity of misuse to change outcomes through behavior change. Accountability should not be
used to adjust behavior, neither top-down nor bottom-up. Delivering effective feedback by
cultivating a culture of psychological safety and growth mindset while also having clear
expectations, all work together to improve system behavior and outcomes.

The only place for accountability in a system is to hold individuals accountable for their
fundamental responsibilities. There is only one type of individual in a hierarchical system that
has a fundamental responsibility given to them by the system itself. That individual is a leader.

Hierarchical social systems grants power and unequal benefits to leaders in exchange for them to
risking themselves for the good of the system. The social system expects the leader to be the first
to dive into the unknown, to blaze the trail and the put themselves in harm's way if required. The
leader's role in a system is to put the sustainability and perpetuity of the system ahead of their
own gain. The only effective role of accountability in a system is to hold a leader accountable when
they shirk their fundamental responsibility as a leader by using the power the social system
entrusted by sacrificing their people for their own gain. Any other use of accountability, whether
it be top-down or bottom-up, leads to a degradation of trust and the system will eventually
collapse.

To use Sinek’s metaphor for great leadership being the alpha wolf--the wolf that gets their
choice of the kill and their choice of mate in exchange for being the first to dive into a fight to
defend the pack--accountability in a pack is the challenging of the alpha when they no longer
put the pack first and are no longer are able to be the first into the fray.
