The first class that I signed up for this semester was Engineering Portfolio Management. I did not
really know what to expect. Part of me thought it would be a portfolio of past projects that have
gone well, similar to an artist's portfolio. But that seemed more like a topic for a seminar rather
than a full graduate class. 

After the first day in the Engineering Portfolio Management class, I understood why I had started
with not knowing what to expect: my experience with discussions around project management in the
software world never extended to _programs_ nor to _portfolios_. Most of the projects and
environments that I have worked in professionally have seemed to be the Wild West instead of using
sound project management fundamentals; including the large scale projects that I have had a part in
leading. I also wonder if the Wild West feeling comes from the startup experience, where there is a
lot of work and less moving pieces to manage.


## Introduction 1.0

My first introduction to project management was in my senior year Software Engineering class in
university. We worked in teams of four and the professor introduced us to Scrum and required reports
on estimations and sprint burndown charts. At the time, I thought it was a lot of extra overhead
work that took away from actually getting code written. But then again, it is hard to see the
benefits of a new-to-you framework without the context of projects that take months and many people
to complete. Team projects at university were only about two weeks long, until we got to Software
Engineering.

The Software Engineering class was helpful going into my first job in industry. While I was a solo
engineer on the Software Support team--the catch-all team for everything that was not net-new
development--I was embedded in and closely observed the best run engineering team that I have worked
with to date (though I did not know it at the time). Though the engineering manager was Scrum
certified, I think the performance of the team came from the relationship between the VP of
Operations and the engineering manager: the trust that the VP had in the engineering manager.

My next role was as a contracted DevOps Engineer at Nike. The organization under the COO was in the
process of moving to an Agile based project management structure. A consulting firm had been brought
in for a multi-year engagement to migrate a 1500+ person organization--reporting into the COO--from
traditional project management to an Agile style. It was really interesting to experience working in
a large-scale enterprise.

The division that our team was in was in the middle of a multi-year migration to SAFe. I got a taste
for what it was like strategizing and planning large-scale projects across hundreds of people. I
experienced what PI planning was like in-person just prior to Covid moving everything remote. The
larger the project, the more time and effort is required for upfront strategy and planning.

The team that I was working fell under that organization rather than the technology organization.
While we had some Operations type work, the majority of our work was project-based building and
delivering configured servers. We had a full-time Scrum Master on the team working along-side a
Product Owner. They would both interface with the Scrum Masters and Product Owners throughout the
rest of the division to keep communication channels open. Our team followed the Scrum ceremonies
pretty strictly.

My next role was also as a DevOps Engineer, but this time at a somewhat established, but smaller,
startup. I was the seventh engineer on the team and the first person in Operations, taking over that
work for the Director and the CTO. The environment that I stepped into was the opposite of the
structure that I had just come from. There were little-to-no project management processes in the
development team. There were objection from the engineers for Scrum because of past experiences. And
in a software startup, the engineers have a pretty strong voice. When the DevOps team grew past a
single engineer, I spun up Kanban. 

About a year in, I was promoted to Lead Engineer on the Operations team. The Development team was
still not using any sort of project management framework outside of assigning a project to a single
engineer and waiting for them to finish it. All of my conversations around the Development team
experimenting with Scrum or Kanban was met with resistance. I thought a tangible example would help,
so the DevOps team switched from Kanban to Scrum, even though Kanban was a bit more helpful. After
about six months of collecting data, I presented the results of what Scrum could do for teams and
the Development teams--now multiple--were standing up Scrum.

A year later, our team was force to abandon our project management processes through extremely tight
deadlines that did not allow room for the processes to work. We spent a year in fire-fighting mode
that led to burnout on the team. Under new leadership, we adopted Scrum again and were back to
having good progress towards the projects and goals that we had.


## Introduction 2.0

While at Nike and the job previous, I was really only in an observational role. I was not a part of
the larger organization project priorities were discussed. In my most recent role as a manager, I
was a part of those discussions.

All project management frameworks rely on some project management process. Leaders have to be
bought-in to that process and trust the outcomes. Leaders also need to have a clear vision of the
strategic goals of an organization and how the projects the organization is taking on are
contributing to those goals.

This is where _programs_ and _portfolios_ come it. _Programs_ are a collection of related _projects_
and miscellaneous activities that are better managed together than separately (Schwable 2017).
_Portfolios_ are a collection of _programs_, _projects_, and activities that all correspond to a
strategic organization objective (Schwable 2017).

In my last few months in my previous role, I worked alongside the new Director to set our team up
for my departure. We immediately spun up a more robust quarterly planning for the Cloud Operations
division and grouped all of our projects (without using the term _program_) and linked those
groupings to a goal (without using the term _portfolio_).

Linking projects to strategic organization objectives had been missing for a while. It seemed that
the organization objectives would change a few times per quarter, which invalidated any planning
that had been done. From a purely project management perspective, with projects now linked to
strategic organization goals, when those goals changed, we could tell which projects were affected.

Coming out of this first week of school, armed with new terminology and with the [unsurprising]
knowledge that there is a whole new-to-me world to explore in program management and portfolio
management, I am excited to dive in. I am curious what lessons I can learn and relate back to past
experience.
