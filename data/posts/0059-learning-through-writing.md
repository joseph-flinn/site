Over the last year or so I have learned a lot. I have learned a lot about myself, and a lot about
humans and communication. The majority of this learning came from reading on my personal time,
writing about what I was learning, and then using that new-found knowledge in applicable scenarios
at work and in life.

Learning is one of my two core values. For some reason, I believe death would be better than to stop
learning. I joke that I have only a single hobby: to collect other hobbies. This is a different way
of saying that I am driven to push myself to learn new things all the time. I constantly have
hundreds of browser tabs open and web pages bookmarked that are associated to things that I want to
learn about; mostly in relation to ideas that I have or things that I want to build.

There are two main categories of learning: learning through experience and learning through writing.
Both of these are unique in their own ways, but work together to form the full basis for learning.
One does not necessarily come before the other, and there are some things that are better learned
through experience than writing.

In my continuous search for new things to learn, my most recent has been West Coast Swing. I was
drawn to West Coast Swing the playfulness that partners seem to have. I did not know WCS, so my need
to learn is satisfied. The ceiling to WCS performance is also really high, so I will be quite
content to stay and continuously learn for a long time. Learning a skill like WCS takes a lot of
experience (ie practice). The body needs to learn how to move through space with and without a
partner. This is something that is hard to learn without the physical experience. However, even
though this is very much a physical skill to learn, there is also an opportunity to learn through
writing. There are some rules/guidelines and thoughts that writing could help with learning. 

John C. Maxwell said "You never really know something until you teach it to someone else" (2011).
Writing is a form of teaching an unknown student. Writing is all about communicating a thought,
idea, or mental model to others. It is in the act of writing that nonlinear thoughts of experiences
and past knowledge become linear and are [hopefully] delivered in a clear linear stream of thought.
In its linear written state, thought can be tested for validity. Nonlinear thought is hard to test
with logic (Karlsson 2023).

I have fallen in love with writing over the last 14 months. I am so grateful that the drive to learn
how to write pushed me to start. Through the process I have stumbled upon the idea that I have been
missing one of the best ways to learn. Writing is learning and learning is writing (Zinsser 1989).
Even though it has taken me a while to discover this love, I am happy that it was later rather than
never. As clich√© as it sounds, the only way for me to continue to get better is by writing more;
learning through experience. And hey, maybe someday I will write about writing.
