I grab my coffee and sit down on my couch. I have just finished my morning routine and am ready to
start in on what the day has in store. My digital life is inches away to my left. This is how I have
started every morning for the last few months. I take a sip of my coffee and set it down to boot up
my laptop. After logging in, I quickly navigate to my daily journal which is quickly becoming my
newest old friend.

My journal seamlessly replaced the structure and routine in this new life without expectations from
work colleagues. My schedule is completely up to me, which is almost too free. The journal helps set
goals and ground me in making progress towards those goals.

A few years ago, I remember a conversation with my uncle about task prioritization. I had recently
been promoted to manager from a technical role, and was drowning in the new world that required
people skills over technical skills. I would go to bed knowing what tomorrow's priority was, but log
on in the morning to find a new fire to fight. My uncle's advice was to ask myself "What is the
one thing that will push us towards our goal this week (short-term)?" and "What is the one thing
that will best set us up for our long-term goals?" This idea was echoed in _The 80/20 Manager_
(Koch, 2013), find the highest priority for the day and do nothing else until that task is
completed.

Unfortunately, as a manager I ran into trouble with the constant shifting goals and priorities.
Attempting to align team goals to unknown or constantly-shifting organizational goals is a recipe
for burnout. Add to this the struggle of determining what daily fires were wild fires versus
candles, the daily practice of setting of intention and priority did not take off.

Moving into my next chapter of graduate school, there is the lack of structure that was previously
provided by the four to six hours of meetings I had most days. I needed to find a replacement.
Starting a daily journal was exactly the structure that I needed. My current entry template looks
like the below. I expect it to evolve as needed, but this is sufficient for now.

```
# 2024-10-21

I use this section to reflect on yesterday after a night's sleep. I am still improving on using a
lens of gratitude in this reflection.

I also use this section to set an overall intention for the focus of the day. Sometimes this is a
more robust overview of the high priority tasks for the day, and other times it is more vague and
hope oriented.


## Today's Plan

- [ ] Today's highest priority
- [ ] Another high priority
- [ ] (stretch) Something that I would like to get done today, but is not imperative
- [ ] (stretch) Another thing that I would like to get done today if I have time


## Left off

This section is used to summarize any tasks that were started today and were not able to be
finished. This section is critical when working on technical tasks or projects that span multiple
days or weeks. It is a quick way of rebuilding context paired with the more in-depth Task notes
below.


## Notes - Tasks

### Task 2

If I have notes on one of today's priority tasks, they will go in this section. This is extremely
useful for largely vague tasks for a project that spans multiple weeks or is extremely technical. I
use this section heavily to track key decisions and things that I have tried.

For example, a few months ago I was working on installing NixOS on a Libre Potato v1 single board
computer. There was not a straight forward tutorial on how to do it successfully and it took a lot
of trial and error to flash the bootloader to the correct storage medium and and install the OS on
another. Taking note of all of the steps that I tried and the outcomes allowed me to track the path
to success; essentially uncovering the solution path in a search tree. This path was vitally
important to "reload" the context the next day. This context reloading was what birthed the "Left
off" section above.


## Notes - Thoughts

### Random Thought
#tag1 #tag2

I often have random thoughts associated with different areas of interest or large life goals that I
am working towards. This section is used to capture those notes. They are more formed and connected
than my Zettelkasten notes, but often just snippets of thoughts that I want to make sure I capture.

However, a major missing piece is the recall of these thoughts. I have tags associated with them,
but do not yet have the means to aggregate, filter, or search these notes specifically. I can use a
fuzzy search through my editor to look for "#tag1", but I cannot list all of the tags used which may
lead to the different tagging schemes to start deviaating over time.

By the end of the year, I hope to have a tool to be able to search, filter, and aggregate my notes.
I am toying with the idea of training a local AI to be a recall agent of sorts, but the most likely
outcome will probably be a CLI tool.


## Backlog

- [ ] A project idea that is not high enough priority to immediately start
- [ ] Another project idea that I do not want to forget about, but also cannot start at the moment
```

My daily journal has become a way to organize the chaos of my inner life and to help me make sure
that I am making satisfactory progress towards the things that I want to continuously move towards.
It is a trusted friend where I can puzzle my way through the brain-cloud of thoughts that are my
constant companions. Having a place to think through them linearly "on paper" calms the raging river
into a stillness between the rapids. When I release a thought into the journal, I no longer have to
remind myself that I have a thought to think about. 

As I continue to rebuild the life that I want to live, the daily act of journaling provides an
anchor in time to build other habits around; things like reflecting on yesterday with gratitude,
creating a habit of daily writing, and building up a contemplative practice to combat an addiction
to success (more on this to come).
