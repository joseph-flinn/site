I grab my coffee and sit down on my couch. I have just finished my morning routine and am ready to
start in on what the day has in store. My digital life is inches away to my left. Every morning
starts like this. I take a sip of my coffee and boot up my laptop. After logging in, I quickly
navigate to my daily journal which is quickly becoming my newest old friend.

My journal has seamlessly replaced the structure and routine in this new chapter. My schedule is
completely up to me which is almost too free. The journal helps set goals and helps ground me in
making progress towards those goals.

A few years ago, I remember a conversation with my uncle about task prioritization. I had recently
been promoted from a technical role into management. I was drowning in the new world that required
people skills rather than the technical skills I had worked hard to acquire. I was going to bed
knowing what tomorrow's priority was, but logging on in the morning to find a new fire to fight. 

My uncle's advice was to ask myself "What is the one thing that will push us towards our goal this
week (short-term)?" and "What is the one thing that will best set us up for our long-term goals?"
This idea was echoed in _The 80/20 Manager_ (Koch, 2013), find the highest priority for the day and
do nothing else until that task is completed.

Unfortunately, as a manager I ran into trouble around organizational goals and priorities.
Attempting to align team goals to unknown or constantly-shifting organizational goals is a recipe
for burnout. Add to this the struggle of determining what daily fires were wild fires versus
candles, daily practices of setting of intention and priority did not take root.

Moving into my next chapter of graduate school, there is the lack of structure that was previously
provided by the four to six hours of daily meetings. I needed to find a replacement. Starting a
daily journal was exactly the structure that I needed. My current entry template looks like the
below. I expect it to evolve as needed, but it is sufficient for now.

```
# 2024-10-21

I use this section to reflect on yesterday after a night's sleep. I am still improving on using a
lens of gratitude in this reflection.

I also use this section to set an overall intention for the focus of the day. Sometimes this is a
more robust overview of the high priority tasks for the day, and other times it is more vague and
hope oriented.


## Today's Plan

- [ ] Today's highest priority
- [ ] Another high priority
- [ ] (stretch) Something that I would like to get done today, but is not imperative
- [ ] (stretch) Another thing that I would like to get done today if I have time


## Left off

This section is used to summarize any tasks that were started today and I did not complete. This
section is critical when working on technical tasks or projects that span multiple days or weeks. It
is a quick way of rebuilding context, paired with the more in-depth Task notes below.


## Notes - Tasks

### Task 2

If I have notes on one of today's priority tasks, they will go in this section. As mentioned above,
these notes are useful for largely vague tasks or for a project that spans multiple weeks or is
on the technical side. I use this section to track key decisions and things that I have tried as
well as the outcomes of those "experiments".

For example, a few months ago I was working on installing NixOS on a Libre Potato v1. There was not
a straight-forward tutorial on how to do it successfully and it took a lot of trial and error. I
needed to flash the bootloader to the correct storage medium and install the OS on another. Taking
note of all of the steps that I tried and the outcomes allowed me to track the path to success,
allowing me to rebuild that path from the beginning and easily replicate it. This context reloading
was what birthed the "Left off" section above.


## Notes - Thoughts

### Random Thought
#tag1 #tag2

I often have random thoughts associated with different areas of interest or large life goals that I
am working towards. This section is used to capture those notes. They are more formed and connected
than notes in my Zettelkasten, but often just snippets of thoughts that I want to make sure I have
written down.

A major missing piece in this process is the recall of these thoughts. I have tags associated with
them, but do not yet have the means to aggregate, filter, or search these notes or tags. I can use a
fuzzy search through my editor to look for "#tag1", but I cannot list all of the tags used. By the
end of the year, I hope to have a tool to be able to better recall my notes. I am toying with the
idea of training a local AI to be a recall agent of sorts, but the most likely outcome will probably
be a custom CLI tool that indexes the current note schema.


## Backlog

- [ ] A project idea that is not high enough priority to immediately start
- [ ] Another project idea that I do not want to forget about, but also cannot start at the moment
```

My daily journal has become a way to organize the chaos of my inner life and to help me make sure
that I am making satisfactory progress towards the things that I want to continuously move towards.
It is a trusted friend where I can puzzle my way through the brain-cloud of thoughts that are my
constant companions. Having a place to think through them linearly "on paper" calms the raging river
into a stillness between the rapids. When I release a thought into the journal, I no longer have the
looping reminder that I have a thought that I need to think about at some point. 

As I continue to build the life that I want to live, the daily act of journaling provides an anchor
in time to build other habits around; things like reflecting on yesterday with gratitude, creating a
habit of daily writing, and building up a contemplative practice to combat my addiction to success
(more on this to come).
