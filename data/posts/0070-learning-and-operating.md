!! description: My big life decisions always seem to happen the week of Thanksgiving

---

Almost every year, it seems the week of Thanksgiving (in the US) brings significant questions and
reflection of major decisions in my life. Maybe it is the fact that even east of the high deserts of
central Washington, eastern Washington is still in the Pacific Northwest where the sun goes away for
most of the winter. Or maybe it is the time of year when I pull my head up from what I am working on
or towards to reflect on the larger goals and what I would like to see happen in my life. Or maybe
it is a commitment issue where I constantly chase experiences and where I am at is never what I want
to be. Or maybe it is something completely different that I have not been able to pinpoint.

The first few years of my career brought up the questions of if I should pursue my past goal of
going to graduate school. Two years ago was the decision to pause a part-time construction project
that I had been working on for the prior two years. Last year, it was grad school again. This year's
Thanksgiving reflection is on the choice to go back to school to pursue a Masters degree. 

Learning is one of my two core values. It was this core value that pushed me over the fence to go to
grad school. In 2023, the amount of energy that I was expending in my career was not producing the
amount of learning that I expected. It felt as if my wheels were spinning. The solution that I came
up with was to go back to school in order to devote all of the hours in my week to learning.

There are only a handful of programs in the world that are dedicated to System Dynamics, and as much
of an adventure as it would be, my personal life led me to choose not to move halfway across the
world to pursue one. I instead found a local Engineering Management program that had a few courses
that used the systems thinking perspective.

It was two weeks into the semester when I was faced with the classic choice: do I take these courses
for the grade or to learn the material for the long-term? Learning comes from reading across
different texts (or consuming other scholarly media), connecting ideas across the different works,
and structuring those thoughts in writing. Writing is how we organize thoughts, make a subject our
own, and truly learn it (Zinsser, p.16). 

The structure of courses set up in modules to ease the learning process unfortunately does the
opposite (Ahrens, p.85). Structure allows for easy isolated mental models and easy verification of
knowledge transfer, but does so at the cost of learning over a longer time horizon; years rather
than weeks.

If we assume that the goal of a course is to learn, how do we verify that a student has learned the
subject sufficiently? Verification has traditionally been done through exams and seems to identify
whether or not a student knows something at that point in time. Why do we verify that a subject has
been learned sufficiently? So that we know the student knows enough of the subject to pass the
class, to get a degree, to be certified to the world that they have sufficiently learned a subject.

Working backwards, we can assume that students go to university to be certified that they have
sufficiently learned a subject. They take course to pass the class, and take exams to verify that
they have indeed learned something in the last 12-16 weeks. But this exposes the competing goal for
the student. Systems thinking suggests that systems can only have a single overarching goal that is
being optimized for (Meadows, p.85). If learning for the long-term starts dominating the overall
system goal of getting a good grade to eventually get a degree, there is a high risk of a balancing
loop being activate to optimize for the good grade rather than learning for the long-term.

Two weeks into my new lifestyle as a student, I chose to optimize for grades; sacrificing learning
and living out of alignment with my core value. Living out of alignment with one's core values is a
recipe for quickly becoming discontent and unhappy. This was the start of questioning if a terminal
Masters program was how I wanted to spend the next two years.

Learning best for me comes through immersion into a subject to be exposed to new ideas. These ideas
form a chaotic cloud that connect to currently held mental models. Writing pierces through the cloud
to help organize the chaos and integrate the new ideas into a new version of the mental model. 

The problems in Engineering Management still fascinate me. How do we best structure an engineering
organization to deliver on the organization's strategic goals? How do we improve the processes
across the engineering organization to better meet those goals? How do we grow a resilient
organization? How do we cultivate a learning organization where everyone is a leader? While
pondering these questions, I am reminded of my role model's driving principles: "Writers who
operate" (Larson). As much as I have learned through the courses that I have taken (and cemented
that learning through extracurricular writing), it's time to get back to operating.
