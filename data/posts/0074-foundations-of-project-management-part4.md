One of the first scaling issues that a scaling startup engineering team will run into is in managing
a growing number of projects. At the beginning, there are a lot of ad-hoc processes to get code
written and delivered to users to prove out demand and market fit. After the business has been
proven and the engineering team grows, processes evolve to keep pace and effectively scale with the
teams. 

Project management is one of the core organizational processes that needs to be cultivated just like
all other business function. This is especially important when scaling an engineering organization
in a startup. 

## Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

In 1984, the US Department of Defense established the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie
Mellon University to address the transition of software engineering technology (Schwalbe p.371).
They developed a popular continuous improvement model called the Capability Maturity Model
Integration, or the CMMI, which provides organizations the essential elements of effective
processes. Below is a table of the different levels and their descriptions (Schwalbe p.372):

| Level | Name | Description | 
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | _Incomplete_ | A process is either not performed or only partially performed. No generic goals exist for this level, and one or more of the specific goals for the process area are not satisfied. |
| 1 | _Performed_ | A process satisfies the specific goals of the process area and supports and enables the work needed to produce work products. Although this capability level can result in improvements, those improvements can be lost over time if the are not institutionalized. |
| 2 | _Managed_ | A process has the basic infrastructure in place to support it. The process is planned and executed based on policies and employs skilled people who have adequate resources to produce controlled outputs. The process discipline reflected ensures that existing practices are retained during times of stress. |
| 3 | _Defined_ | A process is regorously defined and the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organizations's set of standard proceses to suit that particular project. |
| 4 | _Quantitatively Managed_ | A process is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques. The organization establishes quantitative objectives for quality and process performance that are used as criteria in managing the process |
| 5 | _Optimizing_ | A process is improved based on the understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in the process. The focus is on continually improving the range of process performance through incremental and innovative improvements |

The CMMI model lays out the path towards continuously improving generic processes, but can also be
applied to project management specifically. These levels can be used similarly to the TRLs, MRLs,
and ORLs from the 
[_Engineering Portfolio Management_](/posts/engineering-portfolio-management-part2) series to gauge
the level of project management process maturity an organization has and what needs to be done in
order to grow into the next level.


## Berkeley's Project Management Process Maturity Model

Berkeley developed a maturity model specific to project management (Schwalbe p.372):

| Level | Name | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Ad-hoc | No project management process or practices are consitently available, and data is not consistently collected or analyzed. |
| 2 | Planned | Project management process, problem areas, and data are informally defined, identified, and collected |
| 3 | Managed | Formal project planning, control systems, and data are managed |
| 4 | Integrated | Program management is used, and project management data and processes are integrated and quantitatitvely analyzed, measured, and stored |
| 5 | Sustained | Project management processes are continuously improved and are fully understood, and data is optimized and sustained. |

While running an analysis to see where your organization's project management maturity level
currently is, it is important to remember that each level builds on the previous. An organization
has to fully pass a level before moving onto the next. For example, I have worked on a team where we
were continuously improving our project management processes. The processes were relatively
understood and we were storing and optimizing project management data. By definition, it may have
looked like we were operating at a level 5 of project management maturity, but we had not implmented
program management at the organizational level, so had yet to pass level 4. 


## Conclusion

Berkely's Project Management Process Maturity Model is a great roadmap for every organization that
is scaling. Growing the organization's project management capabilities is foundational to delivering
customer value. The trick is to know when the advancement to the next level is required. Once the
engineering team has moved past the single project to show market fit and , it is time to start
getting serious about growing to the _Managed_ level.

When a startup is confident in being around long enough to have a two or five year plan, it is time
to start implementing portfolio management to make sure that all project investments are aligned
with the organization's mission, values, and vision. The specific timing may look a little different
for every organization; however, one glaring sign for the need of program and portfolio management
systems is the existance of a rogue project. If a project is found that is not aligned with the
organization's mission, values, and vision, it is imperative to start implementing a portfolio
management process to realign the organization for success.
