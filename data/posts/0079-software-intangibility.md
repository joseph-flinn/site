I grew up with a very active imagination and an almost-overuse of my hands. The days between the
ages of 6 and 10 were filled with creating whole worlds out of small building blocks. During the
summers we would take field trips to the local library and exchange one stack of books for another.
At home we would recreate what we found between the pages with cardboard and duct tape (which turned
out to be my favorite past time). 

Suits of armor made of cardboard sat in the corner ready to be donned at a moments notice. Shields
of scrap plywood and swords made of wood hung on the walls. Bows made of sticks and arrows of
skewers were always within reach. The windmills in the backyard were not going to topple themselves.
I had to be prepared.

When I was 10, something happened that cemented the trajectory of my life. It was sometime in August
and my grandparents had come to visit. My grandfather--being the handiest man that I have ever
met--was working on a house project. Living by the rule "always use the best tool for the job" he
went out and bought a scroll saw to custom cut a piece he needed. A scroll saw is a small craft saw
that holds a thin flexible blade under tension with an arm and moves the blade up and down at high
speeds to cut. When the project was completed and my grandparents went back home, the scroll saw
stayed. The building blocks of the worlds we made slowly graduated from cardboard and duct tape to
wood and glue.

There's so much more you can do with a tool that has the ability to cut intricate pieces from wood.
My imagination was the only limiting factor. Navies of little wooden boats were made, sculptures
following the style of Heather Jansch were glued together from unusable offcuts, negative and
positive space was explored in scroll work pieces.

I love creating and I found a way to make it my career: in being a force multiplier for
organizations, creating solutions to problems to help teams and individuals have larger impacts. The
intense joy that I experience when collaborating with a team to help build a solution that will make
their lives easier is similar to the feeling of completing a woodworking project.

I have been recently reminded of an observation a dear friend and mentor mentioned in a passing
conversation: the intangibility of software drives engineers to hobbies that are tangible.
Woodworking results in something you can see, touch, and smell. Gardening results in something you
can taste. Software is none of those things.

We spend our days deep in our minds wrestling with unique mental models of the system that we are
working on, something that lives in silicone rarely manifesting into the material world. Yes, there
are those few that write code that moves a mechanical arm or moves control surfaces of an aircraft,
where the intangible becomes tangible, but there are so many more that write code that lives its
entire life in a data center somewhere. The only way we know that it exists is because of the lines
on a graph somewhere, like the lines of a cardiac telemetry monitor. We may see the impression that
it has on the world--a package showing up on your doorstep after clicking the "Add to Cart" button
on a website a few days before--but we can't touch the code. We can't apply a little bit more
pressure here or a stretch there to form it into something new. It is just high and low voltages
racing along highways etched into silicone. 

One of the most difficult skills to learn is how to communicate these imaginary systems with others.
There isn't a physical model that you can pick up and rotate to point to a certain characteristic.
Instead, lost of boxes and lines are drawn on a whiteboard, showing how data flows through the
system. Arms wave and hands gesture to fill in the gaps. 

Does it model the system closely enough for one engineer to be able to share their mental model with
another? What if the model is too simple? Is the state of the model a snapshot in time, or does it
need to be accompanied by the verbal explanation from the author to help with the dynamic flow?

The most frustrating professional conversations that I have been a part of have been system design
conversations. Trying to find the correct words to explain something that you have spent months
working on is extremely challenging. Instead of building a silicone-based system with code, I have
to build the system in grey matter with words and ideas. The challenge is amplified when my
counterparts are not naturally curious. 

The amount of money that exchanges hands for the intangibility of these bits and bytes is
overwhelming. Billions of dollars are spent on systems living in data centers with only virtual
representations. It is like someone buying a vacation house from only seeing hand drawn sketches and
then never physically visiting. Maybe the house exists and is being managed as a vacation rental, or
maybe it doesn't and someone is just depositing money into their bank account.

And yet, the world keeps spinning. Bits and bytes sit on disks waiting for their turn to race along
the silicone highways, for a chance to jump out along the fiber lines and go for an adventure.
Products are bought and sold, packages sorted and shipped. Bank transactions flow from one account
to another, changing the digital balances along the way. Aircraft move people and cargo from one
place to another and space craft launch to explore that which is far away.

In a world saturated with the intangible, the tangible is needed to stay grounded in reality and to
avoid getting lost in cyber space. The smell of fresh-cut pine and the silkiness of sawdust is an
experience that cannot be replicated in the virtual. Imagination is the only limit and the world
is open for exploration.
