---

I have recently been pondering the idea of negative space. The absence of something is a just as
important as the existence of something. Both are a part of the whole. 

Taking examples from a few of my core artistic mediums, portraits in graphite use the color of the
paper to create. The sparkle in someone's eye is the absence of graphite on the page: letting the
white of the paper shine through. In most genres of music, there is an ebb and flow of sound.
Tension is built and then released. A note or chord is played and then the musician lets that sound
reverberate before moving on to play the next. Without using the negative space, a sketch would be
the solid color of graphite; songs would be an onslaught of sound. The negative space is just as
important as the positive space. 

An atom is made up of a core of neutrons and protons with a cloud of electrons orbiting it. 99.9% of
the space that an atom takes up is characterized by the empty space between the orbiting electrons.
Similarly a galaxy of is made up for star systems with celestial bodies orbiting them with
incredible amounts of nothingness between. Nothingness is an important part of the whole.

It seems like we have a tendency to maximize the use of positive space when it comes to our time. We
fill our time with friends, family, work, meetings, hobbies, and often do not leave negative space.
The 30 minutes of _time between_ meetings at work feels uncomfortable. Rarely is it enough time to
complete a task, but it is too much time to take a break.

The _time between_ work is an interesting place. When consciously taken, it provides a place for
reflection on life. Henrik Karlsson wrote [a note](https://substack.com/@henrikkarlsson/note/c-95418840) 
last week that really got me thinking about designing life rather than flowing with circumstances
that come from taking on an identity.  Most of my major decisions in life have been with the flow
from an identity that I had adopted. 

While in school, I considered myself an academic, so I did what academics do. I read, I studied
hard, I got relatively good grades. All of this was to prepare me to take on the identity of being
an adult with a job. After making a conscious decision to slightly change fields after
graduation--from cyber security to software development--I went with the flow and took the first job
that I was offered. I worked there and poured all of my energy into that job until there was nothing
left. The only option I had was to take time and recover. The next career decisions were of
circumstance and necessity.

Hunter Thompson spoke to this when asked for advice in the purpose of life from a friend.

> But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by
> circumstance. -- Thompson

[Earlier in his letter](https://fs.blog/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/), Thompson advised to
"strive to be ourselves" rather than to strive to be a fireman, banker, policeman or doctor. It is
not that we cannot be those things, "but that we must make the goal to conform to the individual,
rather than make the individual conform to the goal".

Karlsson's note is on executing this idea. In the pursuit of being ourselves, we must design our
lives around the constraints that we put on ourselves rather than taking on an identity with preset
constraints. If I love to fly planes, but do not like the lifestyle of being away from home as an
airline pilot, how else can I fulfill the love of flying while staying at/near home? If I am an
engineering manager but do not like working 50+ hour weeks, how do I meet the constraints of
solving problems with technology and paying my bills?

The _time between_ is a great place to reflect and change perspectives on how to approach life.
Using product development techniques, I can start to design my life for my sole user. Like a lot of
product development environments, my user does not necessarily know exactly what they want, but
through dialogue and searching with curiosity, maybe those constraints will be identified. Maybe a
design for life will emerge that has a better chance of preventing the need for sabbaticals every
few years.
