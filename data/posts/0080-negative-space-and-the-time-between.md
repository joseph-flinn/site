---

I have recently been pondering the idea of the importance of negative space. Contrast between light
and dark, sound and silence, and busyness and tranquility; each brings their counterpart more
meaning. The absence is a just as important as the existence. Both are a part of the whole.

Taking examples from a few artistic mediums, portraits in graphite use the color of the paper to
create contrast. The sparkle in someone's eye is the absence of graphite on the page: letting the
white of the paper shine through. In most genres of music, there is an ebb and flow of sound.
Tension is built and then released. A note or chord is played with a pause after to let that sound
reverberate before moving on to play the next. Without using the negative space, a sketch would be
solid graphite; songs would be an onslaught of sound. The negative space brings meaning to the
positive space.

Atoms are made up of neutrons and protons with a cloud of electrons orbiting it. 99.9% of the space
that an atom takes up is characterized by the empty space between the orbiting electrons. Similarly
a galaxy of is made up for star systems with celestial bodies orbiting them with incredible amounts
of nothingness between. Nothingness is an important part of the whole.

When it comes to our time, it seems like we have a tendency to maximize the use of positive space. We
fill our time with friends, family, work, meetings, hobbies, and often do not leave negative space.
The 30 minutes of _time between_ meetings at work feels uncomfortable. Rarely is it enough time to
complete a task, but it is too much time to take a break.

The _time between_ jobs is an interesting place. When taken consciously, it provides a place for
reflection on life. Henrik Karlsson wrote [a note](https://substack.com/@henrikkarlsson/note/c-95418840) 
on designing life rather than flowing with circumstances that come from taking on an identity. I
realized that most of my major decisions in life have been in the flow that resulted from an
identity that I had adopted rather than a life or lifestyle that I consciously created. 

While in school, I considered myself an academic, so I did what academics do. I read, I studied
hard, I got relatively good grades. All of this was to prepare me to take on the identity of being
an adult with a job. After making a conscious decision to change fields after graduation--from cyber
security to software development--I went with the flow and took the first job that I was offered. I
worked there and poured all of my energy into that job until there was nothing left. The only option
I had was to take time and recover. The next career decisions that followed were of the same type of
circumstance and necessity.

When asked for advice on the purpose of life, Hunter Thompson advised his friend 
[in a letter] (https://fs.blog/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/), to "strive to be ourselves" rather
than to strive to be a fireman, banker, policeman or doctor. 

> I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors--but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal.

When we do not strive to be ourselves and design our around what we want to do on a daily or weekly
basis, circumstance will inevitably choose for us.

> But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance. -- Thompson

Karlsson's note on designing our lives as a product puts Thompson's idea into action. In the pursuit
of being ourselves, we must design our lives around the constraints that we put on ourselves rather
than taking on an identity with a predetermined set of constraints. If I love to fly planes, but do
not like the lifestyle of being away from home as an airline pilot, how else can I fulfill the love
of flying while staying at/near home? If I am an engineering manager but do not like working 50+
hour weeks, how do I meet the constraints of solving problems with technology and paying my bills?

The _time between_ is a great place to reflect and look for new perspectives on how to approach
life. Using product development techniques, I can start to design my life for my sole user. As with
many product development environments, my user does not necessarily know exactly what they want,
but through dialogue and searching with curiosity, maybe those constraints will be identified. Maybe
a design for life will emerge that has a better chance of preventing the need for sabbaticals every
few years. Maybe through it all, I find an adventure where I do more of what I like and less of what
I don't.
