With reflection on Henrik Karlsson's note about designing lifestyle, I have made a list of my
current constraints:

1. Constant learning
2. Mental and physical energy to continue improving in West Coast Swing
3. Mental and physical energy for a social life
4. Positive cash flow within the next 18-24 months

My goal is to be able to meet these constraints in a sustainable way. Reflecting over my career so
far, the lifestyle that I have adopted while working in the software industry has not been
sustainable. I have taken two sabbaticals--measured in months and not weeks--in the eight years of
my career. Something needs to change.

Having worked for three companies over my career, I now have enough datapoints to see a developing
trend. I tend to throw my whole self into my work; finding my identity in my role and taking on the
lifestyle that comes with it. When I am not at work, I spend at least half of my free time reading,
writing, and learning about how to improve in my role. I would spend 80+ hours a week either
actively working or thinking about work. This has served me well in terms of career growth and
promotion, but at the cost of diversity and balance of experiences in life. 

In any job, there is always a risk of finding a misalignment between where I want to be and the
direction that the organization that I am working for is going. With the massive amounts of energy
invested in growing in my role and career, finding this misalignment ends in pretty extreme burnout,
requiring months away from the industry to dig my way out. 

So, how can I meet all of these constraints? Well, for the next 12-18 months, I am going to be
designing and building my daily life around West Coast Swing. This meets constraints 1 through 3.
Following the fact that I am best when minimizing the number of directions my energy goes, a friend
and I are going to be starting a mobile app project that is loosely related to dancing, with the
distant hopes that we can meet constraint number 4. In all, building a startup seems to be the
current answer.

This post is the kickoff to a series that will follow our progress as we build a startup in 2025:
discussing the problems that we run into and the decisions that we make to overcome them.


## Project Kickoff

Since alignment is the most important aspect of the success of a project, we started there. The team
needed to align on what success of the projects looks like. We determined that getting to an MVP
launch with little to no negative monthly cash flow would be considered a success. Anything on top
of that would be icing on the cake.

| Milestone | Description | Target MAU |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1. MVP Launch | Launching an MVP with the core features is imperative to the success of the product. Getting here in a timely manner will give us more time to achieve further milestones. | ~10 |
| 2. Positive Cash Flow (Business) | Following quickly after the first milestone, getting to positive cash flow for the business is important. | ~50-100 |
| 3. Positive Cash Flow (Personal) | If we can achieve enough ARR, we will be able to cover growing cloud costs and no longer require personal bootstrapping in time investment. | ~1000-1500 |
| 4. Full Salaries! | This is our moonshot! It would be really cool if we could work on the app full-time and make a livable wage. | ~5000-10000 |

Because we have a moonshot of building a company around the product, our initial goal is getting to
Milestone 2. We will be adopting a Product Led Growth (PLG) model that builds the product around
the user and the company around the product.

Every product and company decision will be aligned with this model. Incidentally, lean management
pairs extremely well with PLG with the focus on delivering value to the user and eliminating waste
in the delivery process.

In addition to PLG and Lean, we are going to be following a project development strategy that
incorporates routine check-ins (gate reviews) to make sure that continued investment still makes
sense, even prior to _MVP Launch_. If one of these check-ins results in a decision to kill the
product, we will also consider the learnings getting there a success.

Keep and eye out for an upcoming post will be doing a more in-depth review of our product
development strategy and how we planning for the gate review sessions.
