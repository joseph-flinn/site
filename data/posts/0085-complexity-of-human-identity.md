Almost a year ago, 
[I wrote about the question "What do you do?"](/posts/identity-dimensionality-reduction) and how it
reduces a complex and unique human down to one or two dimensions, often pertaining to the economic
value of the person you are talking to.

For what seems to be the first time in my life, I do not have a great answer for this question.
Eight months ago I quit my job, the thing that fully defined who I was. But as I shed that identity,
I immediately took on the next: being a full-time graduate student. As I navigated new social
situations and met new people, this was my answer. But as life changes, even this has been called
into question.

Am I a full-time student? Am I a software engineer? Am I a manager? Am I a dancer? Am I a writer? Am
I an outdoorsman? Am I an entrepreneur? Am I a creator? Am I a musician? Am I an athlete? Am I an
academic? Am I a philosopher? Am I an artist?

There is a temptation to find that sole identity, to be secure in the idea that I am something: to
take that foreign identity, embody it and take on its activities. "To become" instead of "to be".

But in this space, choosing only one identity creates artificial limits to who I am or can be. I
might be a full-time student. I might be a dancer. I might be an outdoorsman. I might be a musician. 

But above all of this, I am me: a complex and unique tangle of many different identities, constantly
growing and changing as I journey along the path of life. This is why Karlsson's idea is so
important: designing your lifestyle around my daily activities and embodying the identity that is
the result [1]. I do not have to choose an identity. Not a single one can define who I am. I can sit
in the nuanced space of being all of these (and more), and yet none at the same time.
