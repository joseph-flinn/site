### Trust

The greatest of the achievements has been the trust cultivated in each relationship with my direct
reports. Every action a person takes includes a trust component. The action either adds trust to a
specific relationship or removes it. While every relationship follows this ebb and flow of trust, in
a hierarchical system like a company, the most important view is the trust of direct report in their
manager. Every action by the manager adds or removes trust in the relationship. Brené Brown calls
this idea the marble jar (Brown 2018). Jocko Willink calls it leadership capital (Willink 2015).

There are those that define leadership as making all of the decisions for a group. The idea of
taking charge and moving forward with everyone falling in line behind and following. This
command-and-control leadership is what people often think of when they think of leadership in the
military.

There are others that define leadership as fostering a discussion and coming to a consensus as a
group on which direction to take. Most tasks require full alignment from the group in order to
succeed. From the history of the United States, if the thirteen independent colonies could not align
on a direction, there would not have been unification. It took decades of discussions (and one could
argue that those discussions continue today) to figure out the details, but there was an overall
alignment on succession.

Both of these definitions of leadership are correct. There are situations where command-and-control
is needed and there are situations where group consensus is needed. For any group that has a
command-and-control structure, the success of the outcome is fully dependent on the group trusting
that the leader has the group's best interest in mind (Sinek 2017).
