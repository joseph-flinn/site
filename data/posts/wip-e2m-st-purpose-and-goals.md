"An important purpose of every system is to ensure its own perpetuation."

"Keeping subsystem and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of a successful system."

"A change in the purpose of a system changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the
same."

"The purpose of a heirarchy is to always help its originating subsystems do their jobs better."

"Trap: Seeking the wrong goal."

"Goals or system purpose is the most impactful leverage points that does not require a paradigm shift."
