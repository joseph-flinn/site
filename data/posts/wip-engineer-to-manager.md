# Stories and learnings from Engineer to Manager


## Successes

- [x] Fostering a psychologically safe space on the team
- [x] Few decisions were made that required expending leadership capital
- [ ] Decreasing the complexity of executing a cloud deploy
- [ ] Production-like testing environment
- [ ] Designed and implemented new ways of deploying the server software
- [ ] Solved countless number of problems for other teams


## Failures

- [ ] Failure by sacrificing personal friendships for an organization (but also cultivating new
      friendships)
- [ ] Failure by creating a Value Oasis
- [ ] Failure to finish migrations before starting on something else
- [ ] Failure to thoroughly enact policy change leads to half-baked systems that don't work
- [ ] Failure to fully remove IC hat leads to becoming the solution (the Trap of the intervenor)
- [ ] Failure in effective feedback: constantly asking/reminding people to do things instead of
      communicating the impact of the behavior (storytelling)
- [ ] Failure to influence, even in my area of expertise
      + WHAT and HOW
- [ ] Failure to understand the role the expertise and ego play (or the lack thereof)
      + WHAT and HOW
- [ ] Failure to grow leaders on the team
- [ ] Failure to communicate effectively with sister team to lessen friction points
- [ ] Failure to create high performing teamwork--trust and support--between the team memebers


## Past Lessons

- [x] Marbles & Leadership Capital
- [x] People Management vs Technical Leadership


## Current Problems

These problems should start scoped to what I currently have power to control

Project Management
- Scrum vs Kanban vs Waterfall
- Initiative Work Breakdown
  + How do I effectively step out of the technical architect role while I am still breaking down technical work?
  + How do make sure that we do not run out of planned/brokendown work to work on as a team?
- Flow of work through the team
  + What does the stream of work look lik for an initiative?
  + What does the stream of work look like for a support task?
  + Process diagraming for the flow of work through the team

People Management
- Manager being a technical bottleneck
  + Why are engineers bringing technical issues to me instead of the Lead?
  + Lead Engineer looking to start a technical sync (without me there) to help break the people managing, planning, and
    communication from the technical leadership
  + How to enable the team to make decisions without me? (I need to stop making technical decisions...)
- Asynchronous communication on ideas (Async Meetings?)
  + How do we maximize inclusivity of perspectives while decreasing time to identficiation?
- Team Topology Tension
  + How do we succeed when expected to be all of the types of teams: Specialized, Enablement, Value Stream, and
    Platform? 
- Metrics for success (OKRs/KPIs)
  + Depends on having a purpose/mission
- The temptation to put the Technical hat back on
  + Protecting current capacity or whiplash from context switching from priority shifts
  + Drops the team process improvements
  + Creates a Value Oasis of security for the team
  + High risk of leading to burnout
