# Stories and learnings from Engineer to Manager

## Past Lessons

- [x] Marbles & Leadership Capital
- [x] People Management vs Technical Leadership
- [ ] Policy requires support/enforcement
- [ ] IC hats and People Management hats
- [ ] Leading from the bottom


## Current Problems

These problems should start scoped to what I currently have power to control

Project Management
- Scrum vs Kanban vs Waterfall
- Initiative Work Breakdown
  + How do I effectively step out of the technical architect role while I am still breaking down technical work?
  + How do make sure that we do not run out of planned/brokendown work to work on as a team?
- Flow of work through the team
  + What does the stream of work look lik for an initiative?
  + What does the stream of work look like for a support task?
  + Process diagraming for the flow of work through the team

People Management
- Manager being a technical bottleneck
  + Why are engineers bringing technical issues to me instead of the Lead?
  + Lead Engineer looking to start a technical sync (without me there) to help break the people managing, planning, and
    communication from the technical leadership
  + How to enable the team to make decisions without me? (I need to stop making technical decisions...)
- Asynchronous communication on ideas (Async Meetings?)
  + How do we maximize inclusivity of perspectives while decreasing time to identficiation?
- Team Topology Tension
  + How do we succeed when expected to be all of the types of teams: Specialized, Enablement, Value Stream, and
    Platform? 
- Metrics for success (OKRs/KPIs)
  + Depends on having a purpose/mission
- The temptation to put the Technical hat back on
  + Protecting current capacity or whiplash from context switching from priority shifts
  + Drops the team process improvements
  + Creates a Value Oasis of security for the team
  + High risk of leading to burnout
