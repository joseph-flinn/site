In addition to Technology Readiness Levels, there is also a similar levels for Manufacturing
Readiness. It doesn't matter if a technology is at a TRL 9 if the product cannot be easily
manufactured or replicated. Similarly, the MRL categories may look different for every organization,
but a general example for physical engineering could look like this (Weber, 2024):

| Level | Process definition/description | Skill required to produce | Production Facilities | Cost Management | Supply Chain Management | Phase | 
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ----- | 
| MRL 1 | General Concept proposed with justification | | | | | Research |
| MRL 2 | Simple test work | Highly skilled and versatile | Facility & process developed in outline form | Broad idea of cost range | | Research |
| MRL 3 | Specific processes proven by producing representative part(s) | | Core process and facilities defined | Overall cost target & business case defined | Identify specialized processes required | Research |
| MRL 4 | Process fundamentals rully understood and rate capability proven | | Approach and budget defined | | | Development |
| MRL 5 | Validated on production equipment & tooling | Skilled operator | Production process modelled | Item-by-item targets | Make vs Buy Comparison | Development |
| MRL 6 | Production process defined | Trained production operator | Production process trialed | Full business case agreed ahead of MRL 7-9 commitment | Critical suppliers selected | Development |
| MRL 7 | | | | Validated by quotes | | Deployment |
| MRL 8 | Production facilities & tooling used | | Production facilities installed | Cost & business case validated in prouduction | All suppliers selected | Deployment |
| MRL 9 | Facilities & tooling in routine | | Facilities proven at production rate | | Routing MRP scheduling in place | Deployment |
| MRL 10 | Production process running under statistical process control | Full rate production personnel & skill set definitions in place | Surge capacity for higher production rates understood | | Supply chain lifecycle management established | Full Production |
