Every organization can be examined as a social network
(discrete mathematical graph [[2](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)>)]), with every individual
being a node (or vertex) in the graph and each node bi-directionally connected to every other node. This is the
theoretcial maximum of all communication paths possible in any organization. A communication channel is a set of
communication paths that are used together to communicate to multiple people at the same time. For example, an email
sent out by the CEO to the `all-company@organization.com` email alias sends information directly to all nodes in the
graph in an omnidirectional fashion.


- Lack of organizational alignment
- Lack of transparent communication (channels first, DMs for only private/sensative topics)
- Lack of trust in the organization
- The above are leading to a lack of inclusive communication.
