## Problems in my control

These problems should start scoped to what I currently have power to control

- Initiative Work Breakdown
  + How do I effectively step out of the technical architect role while I am still breaking down technical work?
  + How do make sure that we do not run out of work to work on as a team?
- Manager being a technical bottleneck
  + Why are engineers bringing technical issues to me instead of the Lead?
- Flow of work through the team
  + What does the stream of work look like for a support task?
  + What does the stream of work look lik for an initiative?
  + Process diagraming for the flow of work through the team
- Asynchronous communication on ideas (Async Meetings?)
  + How do we maximize inclusivity of perspectives while decreasing time to identficiation?
- Tension between team topologies
  + How do we succeed when expected to be all of the types of teams: Specialized, Enablement, Value Stream, and
    Platform?
