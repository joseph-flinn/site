Using the TRLs and MRLs (or ORLs) in conjunction with a portfolio management system creates a
transparent process to push projects through across the entire engineering team. It provides an
extremely robust and collaborative approach projects. Like with most organizational process, the
timing of the different TRLs and MRLs will be unique to each. However, they should be operating in
parallel during the phases of the portfolio management system. These examples use Research,
Development, and Deployment and pair three levels each, but this isn't the only way to do it. It
might make more sense to pair MRL 2 with TRL 6 or some other combination. As mentioned a few times
in [Part 2](), we are building up to review portfolio management systems and gate reviews in 
[Part 4]() and how TLRs and MRLs (or ORLs) fit.
