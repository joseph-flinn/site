  Thoughts around business leaders calling people resources

---

The year of 2023 was the first year that I heard the term "resource" applied to a human in a
business context, other than being referred to as a source of information. Something didn't sit
right with me, but I couldn't find the words for why until now. 

Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines _resource_ as: "1) a source of supply or support: an available
means, 2) a natural source of wealth or revenue, 3) a natural feature or phenomenon that enhances
the quality of human life, 4) computable wealth, and 5) a source of information or expertise"

Let's quickly knock out the third and fourth definitions of _resource_. While I do think humans are
natural phenomenons and human connection enhances the quality of life for other humans, that wasn't
what was being talked about. And the conversation was not on computing the sum total of human life
([this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9fHCrP8hZM) was life changing).

Neither the first nor the second definitions of _resource_ sit well with me. The second implies that
people are a natural source to use to build wealth or to create revenue. Or in other words, one
person using another person or a group of people to build wealth and profit. The first is by far the
least bad of the two, but there is a knife edge to walk. "Available means" leads me to ask "to what
end?". If the answer is anywhere near "wealth" or "revenue" the first definition turns to the
second.

Maybe this is just a me thing. Maybe I am too sensitive to feeling like I am being used and hearing
others talk about using other people hits too close to home. Maybe I have an issue with losing sight
of the human-ness in the abstraction of talking about us as a _resource_.

Instead of thinking about humans as resources to use, I think of us as opportunities to collaborate
and to build a team. Through collaboration we can go far: "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you
want to go far, go together."
