  A discussion on a framework to manage for high performance.

---

It is coming up on my anniversery of being away from the software industry. I miss being a manager.
I miss the intersting organizational problems. I miss collaborating across teams to drive goals in
something bigger than myself. I miss supporting my team and watching them deliver extraordinary
results: my personal wins being their professional wins.

As I slowly enter back into the industry and get resituated, I am reminded of an "equation" for
managing for high performance that I learned from my management coach.

> High performance = purpose + expectations + feedback (continuous)

But before this equation can be effectively deployed into a team, the team has to be ready. I have
discussed the building blocks to get to high performance before, but have yet to bring them all
together with how I think about cultivating them.

## The Building Blocks

![High Performing Building Blocks](/posts/0091/high-performance-building-blocks.png)

Each of these could be--and has been--a post of its own. Today I want to run through them at a high
level and discuss how I think about cultivating them on my teams. We'll start at the bottom and
build up from there.


### Trust

The foundation of high performing teams is trust. Google discovered this for themselves in their
two-year study of what makes a high performing team 
[[1](https://www.acc.af.mil/Portals/92/Docs/ACC%20Bridge/Physcological%20Safety/HBR%20Harvard%20-%20Psych%20Safety%20copy.pdf?ver=PZYHiFFdxHXHSm39BAxisQ%3D%3D)].
The Navy SEALS would also rather have a moderate operator with high trust than a high operator with
low trust [[2](https://simonsinek.com/books/leaders-eat-last/)]. If you do not trust that both your
manager and teammates have your back, Maslow's first and second levels of needs are at risk. An
individual is going to be expending energy to meet those needs, energy that could otherwise be spent
pushing forward team and business objectives.


### Psychological Safety

Building from the foundation of trust, we get to the tactical implementation of cultivating
psychological safety.

Simon Sinek has an idea called "the circle of safety"
[[3](https://simonsinek.com/stories/the-circle-of-safety/)]. Every individual in an organization has
a circle in which they feel safe, where they know that all threats are outside the circle. The best
case scenario the circle being at the boundary between the organization and the rest of the world.
In such a scenario, everyone in the company fully supports everyone else. There are no threats from
within. Individuals' energy is spent pushing the company's mission forward towards their vision. The
only threats to safety is from outside the organization.

If the circle is at the team boundary, the team has each others' backs. Every team member knows that
every other member is for them. It is imperative to cultivate a team culture where members are not
against each other. While every individual has strengths and weaknesses, individuals on high
performing teams use their strengths to support their teammates weaknesses so that the team moves
forward as a unit. The leaders of these teams lead by example. 

I think of trust in a relationship as a bank account. Every action or inaction either adds or
removes trust. If I say I'll do something and I follow through with it. A little trust goes into the
account. If I fail to follow through with what I said, a little trust goes out of the account. If I
fail to follow through, but then take full responsibility, trust may flow out but then some may be
added back. However, I always keep in mind is that withdrawing trust can be done in large amounts
but adding trust is only possible through small deposits.

#### Tips
> - Persistently cultivate the "circle of safety" at the team boundary (at the very least)
> - Think about trust as a bank account
> - Trusting first builds trust more quickly (rather than making someone earn your trust)
> - Cultivate trust at all costs
> - Team performance is reflective of the team leader


### Purpose

The motivation of teams and individuals are driven from their purpose. Purpose is directly tied to
Maslow's third and fourth level of needs. Teams and individuals need to know where the belong, and
purpose is the main connector in an organization. With their purpose understood, individuals have a
clear path to achievment and recognition in Maslow's fourth level

The purpose of a team is derived from where the team fits the company's strategy in executing its 
mission. It is a mistake to think that a team's purpose is static. As a company's strategy in
executing their mission changes, a team's purpose may change as well. It is extremely important to
continuously align the team's goals with the company goals. Anything else causes dysfunction in the
organization.

#### Tips
> - Continuously align the team's goals with the company's goals
> - Understand where the areas of responsibility are between teams (and own them)
> - Well defined purpose empowers teams to autonomously solve problems and deliver extraordinary results


### Expectations & Feedback

Expectations and feedback are a self-feeding loop. In a new working relationship when someone is
joining the team, something more formal like a code of conduct document may be used to set general
expectations. In addtion, current team culture may implicitly set social expectations when joining
the team. In ongoing relationships, when I find that my expectations have not been met, but neither
have I explicitly communicated those expectations, feedback is best way to set those expectations.

To deliver feedback, I use a modified SBI model: [**P**ermission], **S**ituation, **B**ehavior,
**I**mpact, [**Q**uestion]. 

**Permission:** First ask permission to give them feedback. This allows the individual to prepare
themselves to receive feedback. It also allows them to communicate that it isn't a good time to
receive feedback. They may not be in the right head space to accept feedback of any kind.

**Situation:** Set the scene with the specific situation where the observed behavior took place.
This helps anchors the conversation in reality and allows the individual to remember what was
happening and what their specific thought processes were at the time.

**Behavior:** Describe the behavior that you _observed_. An observation is central to the observer
and cannot be argued with, but at the same time allows for the observation to be incorrect. It is
important to avoid using the word "you" in these conversations. This risks assigning the behavior of
the individual to their identity. If the externally assigned identity does not match their internal
identity, it is essentially the same as a death threat
[[4](https://charlesduhigg.com/supercommunicators/)]. 

**Impact:** The focus of the feedback should be on the impact of the behavior. This helps the create
understanding and leads to be best chance of change. The information used in the individuals
decision making loops are updated for similar situations in the future. It also helps communicate
where the observer's concern is coming from.

**Question:** There are two types of questions: requests for explicit behavior change or requests
for more information. In a remote environment, behavior may be harder to directly observe. Reverse
engineering behavior from impact is less-than-ideal and can land the observer in some sticky
situations. However, those impacts cannot go unaddressed. Taking on a perspective of curiosity,
sharing the situation and impact and asking about what happened can often help reveal the behavior
that needs adjusting. These conversations are more challenging because they are so dynamic. But
through practice over time the skills can be refined.

Effective feedback is a critical skill to continuously develop. When done improperly and without
psychological safety, feedback can trigger existential threats all the way down to the first level
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: the loss of food and shelter through the loss of a job.

A culture of continuous feedback feeds into building more trust. Individuals know that their manager
is there to support them and their growth, rather than to take advantage of them. When a continuous
feedback culture is developed between teammates, it tightens the bonds that hold the team together.
Everyone knows that everyone else is supporting them in their growth as well.

#### Tips
> - Approach every conversations with open curiosity (especially in a remote work setting). 
> - Avoid the word "you" at all costs.
> - Cultivate a team culture of continuous feedback


## Conclusion

Teams of people are like gardens. They require loving cultivation to bear the most fruit. These
building blocks are the foundations that I use to cultivate high performing teams. Trust is 
absolutely paramount and must be built at all costs. All of the other actions feed back into
creating trust.
