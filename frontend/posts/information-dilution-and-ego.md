  A discussion on the dangers of reliable sources, generative AI, plagiarism, learning and ego

The state of today's information age poses an existential threat to critical thinking. It is much
easier to reach for a search engine and ask a question to see what other people are thinking rather
than thinking for oneself. The skill of critical thinking is becoming ever more important as the
information that we depend upon is becoming less dependable and less qualitative.

In the past few years, I have timidly attempted to keep up with the major happenings in the world.
It has been extremely challenging to find a reliable source of information; between the
disinformation campaigns and the general overt biases in news articles. No matter what beliefs one
holds, there there are media outlet that caters to held mental models. The outlets only show
information that aligns with their chosen mental models which short circuits the double-loop
learning model and prevents learning (Sterman 2009).

Media outlets catering to specific mental models is not a new phenomenon. It can somewhat be
overcome by subscribing to multiple outlets with opposing views to allow for a larger perspective.
What worries me is the blatant plagiarism found across these major media sites: the same articles,
word for word, published by different authors. Whether this is a conscious decision by the outlet
(one author directly copying work from another) or unknown to them (a ghost writer selling the same
article to two different outlets to be published under different authors), the source dishonesty
results in the same dilution of the accurate information. In addition, generative artificial
intelligence still in its early stages, is being trained on what is supposed as human-original data.
It is then being used to generate content to be published in human work. With both of these, I fear
the quality of information is headed in an exponential decline.

The dilution of the quality of information and the duplication is creating a lot of informational
noise. The human species is not identifying and keeping worthy information and discarding unworthy,
but instead keeping and hoarding it all. Memory selection is a very important part of idea
generation. If we remembered everything, it would be as if we remembered nothing. There would be too
much noise to cut through to get to the important information (Ahrens 2022). 

Wading through noise to get to the important information takes a lot of time and energy which takes
time and energy away from learning and generating new ideas. It also takes more time and energy to
find credible sources to provide multiple perspectives on the same subject.

Insight and learning is predicated by curiosity (Ahrens 2022). Without curiosity about opposing
views, one does not search for different perspectives that challenge currently held mental models.
These opposing models are the ones that provide the most opportunity for learning and insight
because the difference is so great. But often ego gets in the way (Holiday 2016). We stick to the
sources that align to our mental models. Humans do not like being wrong and the quickest way to
discover that one is wrong is to be curious and learn something from an opposing view.

The embodiment of ego is the obsession with anything but the present (Holiday 2016). It is being
obsessed about a future where someone may pass judgement because of previously held incorrect
belief. It is being obsessed with the self-judgement that an incorrect view was held in the first
place. Ego obsesses about what has been and what is to come.

Ego is the enemy of curiosity and learning. It works extremely hard to avoid an unfiltered look at
current mental models in search of improvement. It sees continual improvement as being constantly
incorrect instead of becoming a better version of oneself. It sabotages growth. Letting go of ego--the
identity of self--is difficult but is necessary to improve and grow . Ego kicks, screams, and cries
for us to keep holding on to it but we must not listen.

Eastern cultures use meditation and practices like yoga to train the individual to let go of the
obsessions with the past, the future, and the self's place in it. These practices are used to stay
grounded in the present, reminding that "one hand of tranquility is greater than two handfuls of
toil."

It is much easier to reach for a search engine to find the mean of human thinking to absorb for
ourself. Instead, take the more challenging road, let go of ego, cultivate curiosity, develop
critical thinking, and "Dare to know! Have the courage to use your own understanding" (Holiday
2016).
