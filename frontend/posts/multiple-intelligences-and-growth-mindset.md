  A season of learning from the perspective of multiple intelligences and meta-learning

---

Learning is one of my two core values (Brown). Almost everything I do can be traced back to
learning. I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn new things and improve skills that I
already have. I love the learning curve, the steeper the better.

The past seven months has been a season in life with a heavy focus on learning. Starting a full-time
graduate program has required the rigorous execution of traditional academic learning. In addition
to grad school, I started dancing West Coast Swing as a new hobby which has been stretching my
kinesthetic learning. And through all of this, I continue to write to learn (Zinsser p.16).

While I am working on being content in my current amount of learning, I can't help but want to
increase the efficiency of learning--not for the achievement of the acquired knowledge at the end,
but for the learning/growing/stretching process itself.


## Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences

The breadth of focus in my recent learning across academics and body movement has reminded of Howard
Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences [3]. The underlying idea is that there are multiple
dimensions of intelligence that every human has access to use. Everyone has strengths and weakness
across all nine. The below table of overviews has been adapted from the _Center for Innovative
Teaching and Learning_ at Northern Illinois University [3]:

| Intelligence | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Verbal-linguistic | Well-developed verbal skills and sensitivity to the sounds, meanings, and rhythms of words |
| Logical-mathematical | Ability to think conceptually and abstractly, and capacity to discern logical and numerical patterns |
| Spatial-visual | Capacity to think in images and pictures, to visualize accurately and abstractly |
| Bodily-kinesthetic | Ability to control one's body movements and to handle objects skillfully |
| Musical | Ability to produce and appreciate rhythm, pitch, and timber |
| Interpersonal | Capacity to detect and respond appropriately to the moods, motivations, and desires of others |
| Intrapersonal | Capacity to be self-aware and in tune with inner feelings, values, beliefs, and thinking processes |
| Naturalist | Ability to recognize and categorize plants, animals, and other objects in nature |
| Existential | Sensitivity and capacity to tackle deep questions about human existence such as, "What is the meaning of life? Why do we die? How did we get here?" |

I often visualize a representation of an individual's intelligence as a pie chart with different
sized slices associated with each. Nuclear scientists have high logical-mathematical intelligences
with a unique mix of the others. Professional athletes have high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.
Examples can be easily be found for the rest: a monk to existential, poet to verbal-linguistic, etc.
Others can be found that span multiple. A yogi uses their existential and kinesthetic intelligence
through meditation and asanas. A dancer uses their kinesthetic and musical intelligence to pair
their body movements with the music.

The idea that resonates with me the most with Gardner's theory is that having multiple dimensions of
intelligence helps break down ego in "being the smartest". Throughout my childhood I found my peers
competing to be the smartest, the fastest at minute math, the best readers, having the highest IQ,
etc. Gardner's theory allows space for intelligence to be defined in broader and more inclusive
terms. Despite what society may believe, the intelligence capacity is not dependent on whether
someone is an avid reader or if they devote their life to being an athlete.


## Carol Dweck's Mindsets

Carol Dweck's research in _Mindset_ is focused around the ideas of two mindsets: a fixed mindset and
a growth mindset (Dweck). A fixed mindset is characterized by the belief that certain qualities,
intelligence, or traits are carved into stone and cannot be changed (Dweck p.7). The underlying
worldview is that an individual is born with a certain hand and they can only play the hand that
they've been dealt.

A growth mindset is characterized by the belief that the qualities, intelligence, and traits that
you have is a _starting point_ and that an individual's basic qualities can be cultivated and grown
through effort (Dweck p.8). Those with a growth mindset do not necessarily believe that anyone can
do anything (as a 6'3" individual, I probably can't be a professional jockey), but their underlying
belief is that an individual's potential is unknowable.


## Effective Personal Learning

Combining Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences with Dweck's growth mindset, an individual can
grow any of their dimensions of intelligence through effort.

I have spent the majority of my life developing my logical and spatial intelligences--with some
additional minor cultivation in musical, linguistic, and existential. It wasn't until my senior year
in university that I started becoming interested in the application of kinesthetic intelligence. I
became an avid rock climber for a few years which cultivated my body awareness: how different parts
felt at any given time, and where it was in space in relation to the wall I was climbing.

With the changing social landscape through COVID and dealing with an injury, I moved on from
climbing to take up yoga, skiing, and cycling to continue developing kinesthetically. Throughout the
years, even with the last decade focused on developing kinesthetic intelligence, I have found it
requires more effort to develop than my spatial and logical.

My most recent kinesthetic pursuit is West Coast Swing dancing which combines both kinesthetic and
musical intelligences. I have found it to be one of the highest learning curves that I have
encountered--and I love the challenge. The learning curve that it presents is going to keep me busy
for years. 

However, because I love learning and I love learning about learning (meta-learning), I want to
explore to see if I can find a more efficient way to develop my personal kinesthetic intelligence. I
am curious if there is a way to use my strengths in logical and spatial intelligence to springboard
my kinesthetic learning. We'll see what I can find.
