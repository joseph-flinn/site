  Examining and defining the roles of the core product triad in a PLG company

---

In a high performance organization that is following the Product Led Growth (PLG) model, the product
is at the very center of everything, with the user being the center of the product. Lean management
fits extremely well with the PLG model as it looks to maximize value delivery to the user while
minimizing waste in the delivery process. Every department, team, and individual shares the same
goal of improving the product and each one brings a unique and important perspective in this
alignment; playing a specific role in the makeup of the organization.


## The Core Product Groups
### Product

Product is responsible for the value that is delivered to the end user through the product. They are
the collection point for all end user feedback. Their primary responsibility is to collect all of
this feedback, and synthesize it to a problem definition. They also lead the planning on what
metrics need to be collected to verify the problem and calculate the value of solving the problem
for the end user. Product then uses the value calculation to and rank problem definitions against
one another. All types of reasons of why something should be done in the product should be captured
in metrics used to calculate the value. No product decision, whether it leads to financial growth or
not, is made without the data in support.


### Desgin

Design owns and is responsible for designing the solution to a defined problem that Product deemes
the highest value to end users. Solutions and alternatives are developed and user feedback is
gathered to validate the solution. The size and scope of these problems could vary greatly; from a
small change in the corner of a settings page to a complete user experience overhaul. If the
proposed solution is large functionality change that requires significant investment, user feedback
via user research should be done previous to implementation. However, if the scope of the solution
is not large, user feedback comes post implementation and be naturally added to the to Product user
feedback collection strategy. If A/B testing is applicable, it would be used here to enable
in-product user feedback. 

Secondarily, Design uses their user experience expertise to help support Product with user data by
providing user research to help measure and analyze product in support of defining user problems and
prioritizing the defined problems. 


### Engineering

The primary responsibility of Engineering Development is to implement the solution that Design has
developed. Their secondary responsibility is to use their technical expertise to support Design with
review of solutions and alternatives to Product's defined problems. Design leans heavily on
Engineering for the feasibility and complexity of a solution and Engineering is responsible for
providing feedback to assist with minimizing technical complexity. Minimizing complexity is
important to contribute to the overall Lean goals of maximizing value delivery while minimizing
waste. Technical complexity is slow to develop and test which makes it the enemy of Lean since it
causes friction in the fast delivery of value. Complex solutions are also prone to rework which
increases waste. 


## Culture of Experimentation

If the organization's engineering practices support a culture of experimentation and iteration, one of the important
user data collection streams comes from in-product. Increasing the velocity of delivering a minimum valuable product
into the hands of the users to gain feedback enables higher velocity of value learning. The primary business goal of a
product is to delight and deliver value to the users. Feedback on already-delivered product capabilities leads to faster
refinement of what is valuable to the end user: what is worth investing in and what is not. This is the secret to
leading the marketplace. Enabling the culture of experimentation, iteration, and high velocity are the outcomes of
practicing DevOps.

The organization structure should be such that it promotes PLG and Lean management. The Lean
management principles should be applied to the communication channel creation as well: maximize the
delivery of value in communication while minimizing waste of unneeded communication. Organization
communication is the hardest problems to solve. [Conway's

relation to the Inverse Conway Maneuver and the [implications of executing such a maneuver
incorrectly](https://medium.com/@Cyrdup/icm-1-say-no-to-the-inverse-conway-maneuver-6672ba2373cb).
Another article will be written around Conway's Law and the Inverse Conway Maneuver.

In PLG organizations, the Core product groups each have complimentary roles and responsibilities to play in order to
be the most effective. Each business function relies heavily on each other to make up the whole of the core product 
groups to optimize the Lean management goals: maximizing value delivery to the end user and minimizing waste in the
delivery.
