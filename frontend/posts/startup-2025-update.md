  Update on the state of the startup project

---

Life has a tendency of changing when you least expect it. Through multiple meetings with my
cofounder, we have decided to stop pursuing the project as a startup and shift it to a side project
instead.

There are multiple reasons behind this decision. One of the biggest reasons was financial. The
initial financial projections were enough to commit to the project, but required an aggressive
approach where I essentially focused solely on the business administration and marketing side of the
project to start building a userbase before the MVP launched.

The second biggest reason was that recent lifestyle changes led to having less time to devote to the
project. At the outset of the project, we agreed that life is more important than this project and
that we weren't going to sacrifice life for it. Startups require a lot of energy to build
successfuly, so this decision may have prevented the project from ever taking off in the timeframe
we needed. However, that's ok because spending our life energy in ways that bring joy is always
going to be more important than giving it to the non-living company.
