  Discussing one of the largest systems trap my team has been battling.

I have become a student of System Dynamics. Or maybe I always have been without knowing that there
was a field devoted to the study. Through my recent learnings, I have discovered that there is a
systems trap that my team has been battling to get out of for the last two years: shifting the
burden to the intervenor (also known as addiction in some systems)
[[1](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/)].

It is not the structure of the system itself that creates the trap. Meadows goes on to show that
intervenors are sometimes necessary to maintain a desirable state of the system. Doctors are a
necessary part of the biophysical system of the human body. They help intervene in behaviors that do
not serve the overall and long term health of an individual. 

A few years ago, I low-sided my bicycle by trying to maintain my speed through a corner and catching
my pedal on the road. I landed on my hip pretty hard and only took about 50 steps a day for about 14
days. With every step I babied my right leg and hip. Muscles tightened and soft tissue built up all
to protect the injury to allow for healing. I started physical therapy to loosen what tightened and
strengthen what loosened; changing my behavior of babying my leg to using it to get back to normal.
The physical therapist was an intervenor.

However, the trap comes when the temporary intervenor becomes the permanent solution to keep the
desirable state.

On any engineering team, capacity to do work is a stock. For the purposes of this analysis, let's
abstract the capacity to be a constant equal to the number of human-hours that a team has (8 hours
times the number of team members), in a given time period of days (cycle, sprint, etc). This is a
very simplistic model of team capacity that ignores the in-flows of individual capacity degradation
from time-since last vacation, aligned with team purpose, feeling of fulfillment, and many more
flows (a topic for a future post).

When the work assigned to the team exceeds this capacity, one possible intervention is the people
manager stepping in to take some of the load. Maybe this is how the system is designed to function.
Or maybe the team is too big for this to happen. In _An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering
Management_ , Larson shows from experience that a team any larger than three direct reports will
necessitate that the manager must be a People Manager and not a Technical Manager
[[2](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/)]. There are roles and responsibilities that a manager must
do and once a team is big enough (four or more direct reports), those management duties require more
time or capacity from the manager to be relied upon to do technical work.

I have had five direct reports for the last sixteen months and also act as the team's project
manager because we are mostly an enablement team and not a value-stream aligned team
[[3](https://teamtopologies.com/book)]. But in time of pressure from outside of the team to deliver
specific value ASAP, I have taken my people management and project management hats off and put on my
technical engineering hat. It takes the load and pressure off of the team, but sacrifices dropping
the people and project management duties. The issue is compounded by the fact that being an IC is
still a relatively recent experience in addition to the organization action praising "heroes"
instead of working towards building an organization system that prevents the need (Larson also talks
about killing heroes and why it's important [[2](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/)]). 

I identified this problem early last year and have talked extensively about it with my coach. We
have talked about quite a few different possible solutions, but the actual behavior shows that the
solution that I landed on in all of ineffectiveness was "just don't put on the technical hat".

The bounded rationality of the information, incentives, disincentives, goals, stresses and
constraints on the current system is leading to the cycles of decisions of switching hats from
people manager to engineer and back. "Just don't do it" is not an effective solution to relieving
the load and stress on the system that is the team that I manage.

The system needs an overhaul and a redesign. Maybe not to the extent of an "org restructure". Or
maybe to the extent of an "org restructure". There are other points of leverage than the physical
structure of the parts of the system. But the system needs a redesign nonetheless. What does that
look like? I'm not sure yet. It's time to put System Dynamics to work to define some goals, craft
purposes, build some models, and figure out what actions (or inactions) are needed to achieve the
team's purpose.
