  Short discussion on innovation and connecting it to business strategy.

Innovation is one of the driving factors in long-term success for a firm--staying in the game as
long as possible (Sinek 2019). If a firm does not innovate, another firm will and eclipse them in
the market. Once passed, it is extremely difficult to catch up. In Christensen's review of the
history of the hard-drive industry, he showed that the 8-inch drive fully disrupted the industry,
eventually driving all of the companies offering the previous 14-inch generation from the market
(p.19).

Innovation of new technology on its own is not worth much. It must be packaged in a product that
meets customers' needs to have value (Flinn p.8). The implementation of technology without being
focused on meeting a customer's needs is a waste of time and money. A customer is not going to buy a
product that does not fulfill a need (including a chocolate bar that fulfills a current need after a
hard week from my perspective).

Developing a new successful product must include the correct combination of market and timing. It is
a hard problem to solve, but it not unsolvable. If a process can be defined around new product
development, then engineering methodologies can be applied to refine it.

Too often leaders only use intuition to decide what projects and products to pursue. It is a
one-time roll of the dice where the firm is all-in until catastrophic failure. Intuition has an
important place. If there was an algorithm to solve every problem, then intuition would not be
needed to aid in choosing the path forward. However, intuition cannot be the sole reason for
continuing new product development as it often is. The path chosen with intuition needs to be
continuously revalidated with data through research and monitoring throughout the entire process.

I have unfortunately been counted in this group of leaders that have solely relied on intuition to
prioritize projects. Some of these projects are among the biggest in my career. The firm relied on
hiring people with intuition in their fields rather than designing and implementing a portfolio
management system for the entire organization to use for all projects.

Cooper defined an effective new product development process with his Stage-Gate® [1] system (p.95).
The product development process is broken down into five phases. Each phase has a review and
approval gate before the product can progress onto the next phase. All of the work in prior phase
must be completed across multiple categories to be approved to continue. 

The first 3 phases are filled with research and data gathering to validate that the product is worth
creating. Do customers need it? Will customers buy it? How much will it cost to develop? How long
until our investment is recouped? Does the return on investment exceed our firm's rate of return
policy?

Leaders must be wary of any of these questions being answered with intuition rather than data.
Project selection through emotions or politics is symptom of an immature product development system
(Kahn p.160). Customers must be extensively interviewed through the entire process to make sure that
their needs are being met. Not understanding the customer or the market is the number one reasons
that new products fail (Cooper, p.35).

Front-loading the product development process with research and planning increases the lead-time to
start development. This is often seen as a bad thing in the software world where the drive is to be
the first to market to capture as much of the market as possible. However, skimping on the initial
research and planning phases lead to longer development times and more rework causing the overall
cost of the project to increase significantly. The majority of the costs of a project are in the
development execution phase. While speed is important, the rest of the new product development
processes cannot be sacrificed to gain more speed. 

The genius of the Stage-Gate® system is that it builds in escape routes. New product
development is a high-risk high-reward activity. Gate reviews help manage risk by making sure that
product development is progressing well in a quantifiable way across all categories. The system
helps make sure that the right products are being developed at the right time and provides a robust
system to kill the ones that are not making progress in order to maximize the firm's resources.

A Stage-Gate® system is the central piece to successful portfolio management systems.
Successful firms rebalance their project portfolios to make sure that they are investing their
limited resources in the areas that align with their business objectives. It also helps keep the
number of projects low and focused to avoid over-allocating limited resources. Any projects that are
given resources that are not aligned with business objectives or that take away from the highest
priority projects are all risks to staying in the infinite game of business.

One of the most important parts of innovation is having a strategy and a process to support it. A
version of the Stage-Gate® needs to make a comeback in the software industry to make sure that
the firm's portfolio of projects is aligned with the firm's strategy and objectives.
