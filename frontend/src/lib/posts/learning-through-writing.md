Over the last year or so I have learned a lot about myself, and a lot about humans and
communication. The majority of this learning came from reading on my personal time, writing about
what I was learning, and using that new-found knowledge in applicable scenarios at work and in life.

Learning is one of my two core values. I believe not existing would be better than to stop learning.
I frequently joke that the only hobby I have is to collect other hobbies. Each hobby that I collect
comes with a large body of knowledge to learn. Hundreds of browser tabs are open in my browser with
thousands more web pages bookmarked. Each are associated to areas that I want to learn about; mostly
in relation to interesting ideas or things that I want to build.

In all of this, I have found that there are two main categories of learning: learning through
experience and learning through writing. Both of these are unique in their own ways, but work
together to form the full basis for learning. One does not necessarily come before the other, and
there are some things that are better learned through experience than through writing (and visa
versa).

In my continuous search for new things to learn, my most recent has been West Coast Swing. It is a
great example of something to learn through experience rather than through writing. The ceiling to
WCS performance is really high, so the amount of lessons learned is significant. 

Learning a skill like WCS takes a lot of experience (ie practice). The human body needs to
learn how to move through space both with and without a partner. This is something that is hard to learn
without the physical experience. However, even though this is very much a physical skill to learn,
there is also an opportunity to learn through writing. Journaling about what went well, what didn't
go well, and ah-ha moments help cement the lessons learned through the experience.

John C. Maxwell said "You never really know something until you teach it to someone else" (2011).
Writing is a form of teaching an unknown student. Writing is all about communicating a thought,
idea, or mental model to others. It is in the act of writing that nonlinear thoughts of past
experiences and past knowledge become linear and are [hopefully] delivered in a clear linear stream
of thought. In its linear written state, thought can be tested for validity. The swirling
non-linearity of thought is hard to test with logic, without first being linearised (Karlsson 2023).

I have fallen in love with writing over the last 14 months. I am so grateful that the drive to learn
how to write pushed me to start. Through the process, I have stumbled upon the idea that I have been
missing one of the best ways to learn. Writing is learning and learning is writing (Zinsser 1989).
Even though it has taken me a while to discover this love, I am happy that it was later rather than
never. As clich√© as it sounds, the only way for me to continue to get better is by writing more;
learning through experience. And hey, maybe someday I will write about writing.
