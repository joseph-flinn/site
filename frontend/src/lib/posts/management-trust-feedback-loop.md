  Discussing the idea of working relationship trust as a positive feedback loop

---

Trust is my number one priority for the team since it is the basis of psychological safety in a team.
Specifically in the working relationship between manager and direct report, trust is a form of
capital and every action a leader takes over time either adds or removes trust from the bank that is
being built (Willink 2015).

However, there is a missing feedback loop in this model. The actions that are taken by a leader are
affected by the actions of the direct report. Both parties add and remove trust from the bank of
trust in the relationship. A manager's actions will follow the direction of their trust. Their
actions in turn will affect the direct report's perception of the manager and therefore their trust
in them. The direct report's trust will affect their own actions which feeds back into the manager's
trust. This is a positive feedback loop where any one of these components increasing will increase
the others above what they would have otherwise been; the definition of a positive feedback loop
(Sterman 2000).

This is why timely feedback is so important in management. If a direct report's behavior does not
align with the expected behavior of the manager--whether the expected behavior has been clearly
communicated or not--two things must happen quickly. 

Before feedback is given to the direct report, the manager must review the expectation to conclude
that it is a founded expectation and that it (still) fits with the mission, values, or framework of
the team. The mission, values, or framework could be the one imposed by the organization or
they could be from the manager's leadership or management style (one must be careful that
there is no conflict between the organization mission and values and the manager's mission and
values for risk of misalignment). The review and confirmation is especially important if the
expected behavior has not previously been communicated to the direct report. If the expectation does
not fit the mission, values, or framework, it is revised in the manager's mental model and no
feedback for the direct report is required.

If the expectation holds after review, feedback must be given to the direct report in a timely
manner. Timely feedback prevents the direct report continuing the behavior and building a learned trend of
actions, believing that it is an accepted behavior. Preventing this trend is also important for the
manager's trust in the direct report. Without giving feedback to the direct report to correct the
behavior, the manager cannot trust that the direct report's behavior will align with expectations. As an
example, if a foreman sees a worker measuring something incorrectly and doesn't correct the
technique, the next time something needs to be measured, the foreman won't have the confidence to
ask that worker to do the measurement since there is a high likelihood of them using the incorrect
technique to measuring since it wasn't corrected the previous time.

Timely feedback is important for all expected behavior, but most important for behavior that is
directly related to trust. The above example of the foreman and the worker is an example of behavior
that is not directly related to trust. The loss of trust in the direct report does not come from the
incorrect technique, but from the number of times the incorrect technique is used, amplified by the
number of times feedback is given to correct the technique. For an example of behavior that is
directly related to trust, let's look at a possible response to the corrective feedback on the
measuring technique. Let's say the foreman gives feedback to the worker on the technique, and let's
assume that the delivery of the feedback does not play into how the worker receives it. If the
response from the worker is anything less than taking responsibility and learning from the mistaken
technique, responsibility for the mistake has been shifted off of the worker. The behavior of shifting
responsibility and making an excuse directly affects the trust that the manager has with the direct
report.

Timely feedback to correct behaviors that are counter to expectations is crucial for the performance
of a team. This feedback is even more important when that behavior directly impacts the trust that a
manager has in their direct report because that trust behaves as a positive feedback loop;
exponentially growing the trust, or exponentially eroding it.
