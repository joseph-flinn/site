  A quick chat about the future direction of future posts.

The posts so far have been written in a way to paint the world in an idyllic view; the way that specific things should
be done in an organization. I have joked with my closest coworkers that it is my way of getting my frustrations out
with what I am seeing in the world or in the organizations that I work in or closely with. In some ways it has been
cathartic to have a place to explore and test ideas that I have.

However, there has been one huge downside: having an easy escape for a problem has led to less energy being used to fix
the problems in the first place. By channeling my energy into writing the past articles, it has channeled the energy
away from the potential solutions to the problems that I have been facing.

I have been recently pondering a question posed by a content creator to other content creators
[[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRPChBZ0Rjo)]. Effectively, _"What credibility do you have to be saying the things
that you do? Why should I listen to you?"_. In Alex's view, creating content about ideas that are outside of the current
expertise of the person is the number one mistake he sees. This echos some of the other business content creators that I
have been reading for the past few years, _"You are the expert of what you are doing right now. Writing about that
creates more value than hypotheticals."_

Following the advice of those who have gone before me, I am going to be documenting the problems that I am facing on a
weekly basis AND the iterative solutions that have been tried as well as the outcomes of those experiments. I expect
this approach to deliver more value from these posts since they will be based off of real world experiences instead of
academic theoretics (as much fun as those are). 

This is also a bit of a selfish direction in that more of my energy will be used to focus in solving the problems that I
can solve and iteratively improving the issues that I am faced with. I love the theoretical learning by reading and
consuming material. There are a lot of lessons to be learned through other people's experiences. However, practicing
those lessons is the only way to actually gain any sort of benefit from the book lessons. I am reminded about the first
time I rode a motorcycle. I understood the ideas behind a manual transmission and could visualize how a clutch works.
But that knowledge didn't mean that I knew how to use it. I spent the first few minutes of the class dumping the clutch
(not slowly releasing it while also slowly applying throttle). 

Over the last six to twelve months of practicing HOW & WHAT has created a habit of defaulting to that communication
style to pursuing understanding of others' perspectives instead of presenting my perspective first, assuming that we
share a common ground of understanding. Similarly, continued growth in other areas will not be from discussing
theoretics. It must come from actively implementing, failing, and iterating the ideas.

I am curious and excited about this new direction. We'll see how this experiment goes.
