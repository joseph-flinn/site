  An introduction on what is to come over the next few months in retrospect to the last few years

A large scary-but-exciting transition in coming in life. The next step is out of the comfortable
place that I have found and built in a successful company. The company has been a large part of my
life in the last four years.  It seems like a crazy decision to move on where career and monetary
success is all-but-guaranteed; somewhere where I have been tirelessly working to assist with laying
the foundation of something that is going to be amazing.

To quote one of the engineers that I have had the privilege to have on my team, "If you scared, you
have to do it." Learning is one of my two core values, and for the last decade I have been thinking
about how to continue my formal education. But every time I got into a graduate school, the program
direction did not feel right. It was not until I read _Thinking in Systems: A Primer_ (Meadows 2009)
that I found the area of study that I am interested in. The timing is right--or as right as timing
can be--and I have found an area of study that will hold my interest for at least the number of
years it will take for a graduate school program.

In the time of transition, reflecting on the past and on lessons learned is a helpful way of
concluding a chapter and moving smoothly into the next. Learning--more often then not--comes from
failure, yet we would not purchase a book on someone's failure (Holiday 2016). We want to know what
people have done to succeed so that we can try that formula of success in our own lives. But those
stories of success skip over the years of challenges or the years of failure that come before every
success (Holiday 2016). Every story that includes success that is only worth telling if there were
challenges overcome to get there.

However, focusing only on the failures dishonors the successes and wins that the team has
accomplished. In this retrospective, we will do both. We will reflect back on the wins and ways that
we have succeeded and have gratitude. And then we will dive deep into the greatest failures, each
with their own lesson and have gratitude for each of them.
