  Explore the power of WHAT & HOW in Organizational Leadership

---

The first area of impact of the words WHAT and HOW is organizational leadership in business strategy. Creating
purpose in direct reports is one of the three most important parts of managing for high performance for any manager, no
matter if that manager is a first-level technical manager of a team of two or if it is the CEO. Fostering purpose is
essential to align collaboration toward a single goal.

This purpose starts at the definition of the [Simon Sinek's Golden Circle](https://simonsinek.com/golden-circle/) at the
organization level. _"When Simon asks WHY, he’s not referring to making money—that’s a result. Your WHY is your purpose,
cause, or belief."_ HOW and WHAT come after the WHY and Answering each of these questions points the organization in a direction and gets the people to
follow; building purpose. But it doesn't stop there. My uncle, Gordon Flinn, adds another HOW circle after the WHAT:
WHY, HOW, WHAT, HOW. This next how helps translate the overall mission of the organization into the strategy. It also
links any organizational strategy back to the mission, or is a measure of if that strategy lines up with the
organization's mission. 

I would like to keep adding even more concentric circles of alternating WHATs and HOWs after the four above, called the
Silver Rings. Each question breaks down the strategy above into smaller pieces to get tactical. Garry Kasparov likes to
define the difference between Tactics and Strategy as: _"Tactics is to know what to do when there is something to do and
strategy is to know what to do when there is nothing to do."_ This is exactly what repeating the rings do. In a reality
where the next step doesn't exist or is unknown, WHAT and HOW help uncover both the strategy and the tactics to
implement it. Eventually, after asking repeating WHAT and HOW, we will get to a bottom, where this is a set of tasks to
implement and our process of WHAT and HOW have laid the clear path of the purpose of those tasks. The people working on
those tasks can immediately see the impact that their work is having on the overall organizational mission. 

In addition to building the bread crumb trail back to the organization's mission, actively asking WHAT and HOW at the
different levels includes all of the important perspectives of the boots on the ground. When this perspective is sought
after and used, it builds even more purpose in the team; seeing that they have an active contribution to the overall
mission but also have a part in leading the way, no matter where they are in the organization. Training all levels of
management to take advantage of this, build it, and to get out of the way is super important for building the collection
of high performing teams that it takes to build a high performing organization.
