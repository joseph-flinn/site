I am in the middle of moving, so the next few posts might be on the shorter side

These two words, WHAT and HOW, have been the most impactful words with me this year. They have changed how I look
at, and move through, the world. In almost every human interaction, these are the most important tools that one can use,
and they are just getting more valuable and important as the world continues on its digital path.


Over the next few weeks, we'll see how WHAT and HOW plays an important role in Organizational Leadership. They are the
foundation of building a compelling organization, mission, and brand. We'll examine Simon Sinek's Golden Circle idea,
expand on it with what we'll call Silver Rings. These drive the all important alignment across the organization.


Next we'll examine the power of WHAT and HOW in the tangentially related topic of persuasion or negotiation. While
answering the Golden Circle questions, WHAT and HOW play a vital role in the process of aligning perspectives to
answer those questions themselves (wow, talk about idea Inception!). 


After we explore how these words align and maintain an organization's alignment, we'll see how these words are the most
important tools in a manager's toolbox. They can be used to find the best solution to any problem in a collaborative
way. And they are a manager's go-to when coaching Strategic Thinking in their direct reports.


To wrap up the mini-series, we'll examine the underlying themes in why these words are so impactful in these situations.
Taking those themes, we'll see how we can apply them to improve our social lives and the quality of all of our
relationships, not just the ones in a professional setting.


How can two little words be so powerful? What is it about these words that make them applicable in so many different and
seemingly unrelated areas? (Haha! Did you see what I did there?). Let's continue forward together and find out.
