  Discuss covering your ass and why it is a red flag

If the phrase "CYA" (cover your ass, for those of us that are new to the phrase as I am) is ever used in an
organization, that organization is under existential threat. The scariest part is that the threat is from within. Let me
break this down. 

Companies normally have goals that are related to the market. The market is comprised of humans who trade for goods and
services--sometimes illogically--as well as competitors offering similar goods and services. The company is surrounded
by the market, like a circle on a piece of paper. Everyone inside the circle is a member of the company. Everything
outside is a possible threat (market corrections, competitors, bad PR, etc). 

When I am in the circle, the only entities that are behind me are my peers and coworkers; the people that share the same
goals as I do. The phrase "Covering your ass" alludes to protecting against something behind me. If I am
covering my ass, I think that one of my peers or coworkers is an active threat, the same people that should be the ones
that have my back and support me. 

Simon Sinek has an idea called the Circle of Safety [[1](https://simonsinek.com/stories/the-circle-of-safety/)]. The
people inside that Circle of Safety have the backs of those around them. They put the group's interest before the
interest of the self. If that Circle of Saftey does not solely exist on the boundaries between the organization and the
rest of the world--the boundary between the company and the market--energy is wasted protecting against threats from
inside the organization. If the largest Circle of Safety for any one person is at the team level, the team uses energy
to identify and mitigate threats instead of using that energy to push the organization forward. 

If trust isn't the beadrock of the organization, threats exist inside the organization. Humans have to mitigate those
threats before working to acheive the goals of the organization. All internal threats lead to a waste of energy and are
detrimental to the longevity of the organization.

The scariest part of all of this is that trust goes both ways. Trust starts degrading as soon as one party starts to
lose it. The other party can feel it and they start losing it too.  When we start to question if people have our back,
we don't trust that they are there for us. The loss of trust compounds quickly. This questioning is the start of the
existential threat to the organization. _“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it,
earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.”_ --Albert Einstein
