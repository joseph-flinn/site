One of the first issues that a scaling engineering team at a startup will run into is in managing a
growing number of projects. At the beginning, there are a lot of ad-hoc processes to get code
written and delivered to users in order to prove out demand and market fit. After the business model
has been proven and the engineering team start growing, processes have to evolve to keep pace and
effectively scale with the teams. 

Project management is one of the core organizational processes that needs to be grown alongside
other business functions. This is especially important when scaling an engineering organization in a
startup since most of the engineering work is made up of project work. 


## Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

In 1984, the US Department of Defense established the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at
Carnegie Mellon University to address the transition of software engineering technology (Schwalbe
p.371). SEI developed a popular continuous improvement model called the Capability Maturity Model
Integration--or the CMMI--which provides organizations the essential elements of effective
processes. Below is a table of the descriptions of the different levels (Schwalbe p.372):

| Level | Name | Description | 
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | _Incomplete_ | A process is either not performed or only partially performed. No generic goals exist for this level, and one or more of the specific goals for the process area are not satisfied. |
| 1 | _Performed_ | A process satisfies the specific goals of the process area and supports and enables the work needed to produce work products. Although this capability level can result in improvements, those improvements can be lost over time if the are not institutionalized. |
| 2 | _Managed_ | A process has the basic infrastructure in place to support it. The process is planned and executed based on policies and employs skilled people who have adequate resources to produce controlled outputs. The process discipline reflected ensures that existing practices are retained during times of stress. |
| 3 | _Defined_ | A process is rigorously defined and the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organization's set of standard processes to suit that particular project. |
| 4 | _Quantitatively Managed_ | A process is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques. The organization establishes quantitative objectives for quality and process performance that are used as criteria in managing the process |
| 5 | _Optimizing_ | A process is improved based on the understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in the process. The focus is on continually improving the range of process performance through incremental and innovative improvements |

The CMMI model lays out the path towards continuously improving generic processes, but it can also
be applied to project management specifically. The CMMI levels can be used to gauge the level of
maturity in an organization's project management processes, in a similar manner to the TRLs, MRLs,
and ORLs from the 
[_Engineering Portfolio Management_](/posts/engineering-portfolio-management-part2) series. It also
provides a framework on what needs to happen to level up in maturity.


## Berkeley's Project Management Process Maturity Model

Building off the CMMI, Berkeley developed a maturity model specific to project management (Schwalbe
p.372):

| Level | Name | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Ad-hoc | No project management process or practices are consistently available, and data is not consistently collected or analyzed. |
| 2 | Planned | Project management process, problem areas, and data are informally defined, identified, and collected |
| 3 | Managed | Formal project planning, control systems, and data are managed |
| 4 | Integrated | Program management is used, and project management data and processes are integrated and quantitatively analyzed, measured, and stored |
| 5 | Sustained | Project management processes are continuously improved and are fully understood, and data is optimized and sustained. |

While running an analysis to see where your current project management maturity level is, it is
important to remember that each level builds on the previous. An organization has to fully pass a
level before moving onto the next. For example, I have worked on a team where we were continuously
improving our project management processes. The processes were relatively understood and we were
storing and optimizing project management data. By definition, it may have looked like we were
operating at a level 5 of project management maturity, but we had not implemented program management
at the organizational level, so had yet to meet the requirements of level 4.


## Conclusion

Growing the organization's project management capabilities is foundational to delivering
customer value. The trick is to know when the advancement to the next level is required. Once the
engineering team has moved past the initial market fit project, it is time to start getting serious
about growing to Berkeley's level 3: the _Managed_ level. Formal processes are needed to manage the
complexities of multiple simultaneous projects. While formal, the processes can stay lightweight
and flexible to meet any agility requirements from the organization.

Once a startup is confident in being around long enough to have a two or five year plan, it is time
to start implementing level 4: program and portfolio management. When the organization's strategic
drivers start implementing for business longevity, it is important to make sure that all project
investments are aligned with the organization's mission, values, and vision. The specific timing may
look a little different for every organization; however, one glaring sign for the need of program
and portfolio management systems is the discovery of a rogue project. If a project is found that is
not aligned with the organization's mission, it is imperative to start implementing a portfolio
management process to realign the organization to enable success.

Berkeley's Project Management Process Maturity Model is a great roadmap for every organization that
is scaling. It helps guide the decisions on when to invest in process improvement specific to
project management in order to set the organization up for continued success.
