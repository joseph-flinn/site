  A How-To on Power Napping

---

Two years ago, I started adding naps as an option in my daily routine. After shutting my work
laptop, I would check in with my body's energy levels. If I wasn't feeling ready to hop on my bike
and go for a 20 mile ride, it was time for a nap. I would put on headphones and a specific
music-only playlist on Spotify and lay down on the couch for about 30 minutes. I would use a
simple breathing technique that I had learned a few years before to zone out and eventually fall
asleep if I was tired enough.

**Simple breathing technique to relax =>** make your exhale longer than your inhale

While sleeping, the human body has longer exhales than inhales. By bringing awareness to your breath
and a little control to the exhale, one has the power to put their body into a relaxing state. When
this breathing technique is practiced for 5-10 minutes a day, it becomes easier and faster to get to
a mental state of relaxation. Lengthening the exhale helps the mind focus on a single point before
being released for thoughts to freely wander in and out, the mind not attaching itself to any.

As my lifestyle and sleeping habits have changed with dance and with having a partner, the skill of
power napping has become important. I have found myself feeling exhausted at dance events, but
wanting to participate. In such instances, I find 20 to 30 minutes of downtime and a bench or floor
space under a table to lie down. I often choose an less-than-comfortable surface so that I know I am
not going to sleep for the night. I close my eyes and focus on lengthening my exhales. I may not
fully lose consciousness to sleep, but the slow exhale of breath is relaxing. I shoot for 3 to 4
breaths a minute: a 2-3 second inhale and a 17-20 second exhale. 40 to 50 of these breaths will take
about 15 minutes, which is enough relaxation for me to get up feeling more energized, whether or not
I actually fell asleep.

Every body is different with every respiratory system being different. The specific length of
inhales and exhales may be different. When I first started my journey in breathwork--in both
meditation and cycling--such long breaths were not possible for me. The key is not the time it
takes, but the focus on the exhale being longer than the inhale.

I have found this breathing technique handy in managing stress in stressful situations. Taking a few
minutes a day to practice it gets the rhythms into the body. I have observed myself unconsciously
taking a quick inhale and long exhale when I am stressed in high stress situations like large city
traffic.

I highly recommend experimenting with power naps and this simple technique of lengthening the exhale
when needing a quick energy boost.
