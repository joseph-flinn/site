  Discussing the critical failure of not creating enough time and capacity to deliver effective
  feedback.

Delivering effective feedback is one of the core responsibilities of a manager. Feedback is a
crucial part of the learning process. When a manager does not use effective feedback, they are
missing one of the most influential tools that they have at their disposal to manage their team to
high performance. It is crucial element for the growth of the individual in the role and in their
career.

Through management coaching with Marlow, I was introduced to a formula for managing for high
performance: 

> High performing teams = Purpose + Expectations + Feedback

Connecting purpose from the daily work of an individual to the overall purpose of the organization
is an important cornerstone for allowing space to cultivate motivation on the team. If I cannot
connect my tasks during the day to the team's Why or cannot connect the team's Why to the
organization's Why, I start questioning the importance and priority of the task and the value of the
resulting impact. All tasks in an organization should be able to be traced back to the
organization's Why in order to cultivate purpose throughout the organization. If it can't, there is
a good chance that the task is incorrectly prioritized or the organization systems are in a state of
dysfunction preventing alignment. I discuss the approach that I call Silver Circles, building off of
Sinek's Golden Circles (Sinek 2017), in a [previous post](/posts/what-how-org-leadership). 

Feedback is the critical function in any learning system. Feedback loops are the difference between
double-loop learning where a system learns and adjusts its decision policies and single-loop
learning where a system continues to make the same decisions no matter the outcome (Sterman 2009).
In fact, the two core ideas in Systems Thinking are feedback loops and system goals (Meadows 2009).
Feedback can come in many forms (team metrics, success/failure of projects, verbal feedback, etc). A
manager's responsibility is to build and maintain these feedback loops to benefit the team and to
fill any gaps with verbal feedback that metrics and other feedback framework miss.

I believe that expectations are the most delicate of the three areas in managing for high
performance. As a new manager, I wrestled with how to set expectations, what expectations were
beneficial to the team, and what expectations were projections of my preferences. I was pretty
sensitive to creating a homogeneous team by setting expectations and individual growth plans that
were highly personalized to my personality and perspective. 

In the early days, I was also highly sensitive to giving feedback on expectations that had not
already previously been explicitly defined. I know from many personal experiences that receiving
strong or critical feedback on an expectation that was failed to be communicated is a quick way to
lose trust in a leader. However, a few months of having feedback conversations around my
expectations that had not explicitly been set, I realized that feedback conversations themselves can
be a great catalyst to setting expectations that had not previously been discussed. The 
[SBI feedback framework](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/)
is a great tool to use to explain why the expected behavior is important--through the impact of the
unexpected behavior--to then create purpose towards the expected behavior.

In general, I feel like I failed at creating the time and capacity that I needed to build a culture
of continuous feedback. This is one of the direct impacts from so often swapping my manager hat for my
IC hat and falling into the trap of the intervenor 
([discussed a few weeks ago](/posts/retro-failure-trap-of-intervenor)). The higher the pressure on
my team, the more pressure I felt to switch hats and spend time as an IC to release the pressure
from the team. The more time I spent as an IC, the less time I was spending as a manager. The less
time I was spending as a manager, the less effective feedback I gave. The less effective feedback I
gave, the lower the performance of the team as a whole. The lower the performance of the team, the
higher the pressure on the team. The more pressure on the team, the more I felt pressure to do more
IC work to relieve the pressure. This is a great example of the vicious reinforcing feedback loop
known as the trap of the intervenor.


## Gratitude

I am grateful for learning that active listening with curiosity is the "secret" to cultivating
psychological safety which is necessary for setting effective expectations. Leaders will make
mistakes and poor expectations will be set. However, through psychological safety and a continuous
feedback culture, feedback can flow both ways. Direct reports will be more willing to receive
feedback and there is a place for the leader to receive feedback for their own personal learning.

I am also really grateful for all of the opportunities that I had to give feedback (whether executed
or not). Each time I failed to deliver feedback is another reminder of how important feedback is. I
have taken all of these with me into my personal life to improve as a general human being.
