  Explore the power of WHAT & HOW to connect better with other humans

The fourth and final area where the words WHAT & HOW have a large impact is in social circles or social status. Being
likable and remembered is important for networking and finding business opportunities. Humans rarely, if ever, achieve
something in a vacuum. Human connection is a need. Building a strong social circle that supports your purpose serves two
things:  1) creating social or business opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be there, and 2) increasing a person's
natural resources of Community (_Your Money or Your Life_ [[1](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book-summary/)].

In her book _Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People_ [[1](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/captivate/)],
Vanessa Van Edwards discusses skills and techniques to overcome awkwardness at networking events or other social
gatherings (among a great many other things). One of those tools that she explores is something that she calls a Spark:
the piqued curiosity between two people that connect them and fosters a desire to learn more about the other. Using
"Sparky questions"--open ended and unexpected questions--to create a Spark and start and initiate the human connection.
The human brain is wired to seek out novelty [[3](https://www.ciis.edu/news/novelty-keeps-your-brain-healthy)], so these
types of open ended question _spark_ the curiosity that starts that creates an immediate interest in the conversation.

Connecting Van Edward's work to Chris Voss's work in _Never Split the Difference_
[[4](https://www.blackswanltd.com/never-split-the-difference)], we can expand those open ended _Sparky_ questions to be
open ended WHAT & HOW questions. Expressing genuine interest and curiosity in other people creates that connection.
People want to feel understood and heard, and providing that for other people in an individualistic society creates it.
Through human connection, social networks grow stronger. As people felt understood, there is space to then reciprocate
and give understanding back, further strengthening the connection. Making a habit of this creates a social gravity. The 
more people come into the orbit, the more opportunities there are for people to connect those around them, to match
complimentary needs in both parties. These opportunities could be social, in business, or even other needs (finding a
mechanic, finding an accountant, etc.)

Social community is super important for a healthy human. A study found that a rat that is isolated from other rats
self-administers drugs, but when joined with other rats, chooses not to self-administer
[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386559/)]. Addiction in humans is not dissimilar. 

Moving beyond the basic need for human connection and community, Vicki Robin explores the idea of differences between
national resources (money and assets) and natural resources (Community, Love)
[[1](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book-summary/)]. Being a billionaire living in a windowless room with no outside
connection is pointless. In addition, from a financial perspective, Community decreases the financial needs of normal
life. Doing everything solo costs a lot of money. Becoming a pilot and buying a plane costs hundreds of thousands of
dollars, but an airplane ticket only costs a few hundred. Similarly, county snow removal is a part of what the country
provides and costs a lot less in taxes (a few dollars a year) than purchasing a tractor and keeping the road clear (tens
of thousands of dollars). This can go for just about everything.

Community also builds purpose. Purpose for one's self is a fruitless endeavour 
[[6](https://simonsinek.com/books/find-your-why/)]. _Enough_ will never be enough. However, purpose for a broader
community brings motivation and working long days is not as painful because there is a larger goal than one's self;
leaving the world better than you found it.

Human connection is a necessary part of the human experience. It fills basic human needs, but also opens up social
opportunities, business opportunities and more. Connection and Community creates purpose and motivation to do good in
the world. And this purpose and motivation can lead to a better relationship with finances to be able to maximize one's
fulfillment by maximizing life energy used for pushing forward one's purpose.
