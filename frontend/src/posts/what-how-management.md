  Explore the power of WHAT & HOW in people management

The third area of impact of the words WHAT and HOW is people management: building psychological safety on a team. The
[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust) found that the affect of trust on
self-reported performance was powerful.  Comparing the top and bottom quartiles (get ready for a stats dump), respondents
in the top quartile indicated that they:

- were 50% more productive
- were 70% more aligned with the company's purpose
- had 106% more energy
- were 76% more engaged at work
- found 60% more enjoyment in their job
- felt 66% closer to their colleagues
- depersonalized workmates 41% less
- experienced 40% less burnout

Dr. Timothy Clark's book, 
[_The 4 Stages of Psychological Safety_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/617259/the-4-stages-of-psychological-safety-by-tim-clark), 
define the 4 stages of psychological safety as:

1. included
2. able to learn
3. safe to contribute
4. safe to challenge the status quo

_Inclusion_ is being brought in, asked to participate, and being actively listened to; no matter who you are, no matter
seniority, no matter your background. Bridewater Associates takes it to the next level by leaning into "idea
meritocracy" and "radical transparency". They _expect_ all ideas to be shared, no matter if they come a VP in the
company or if they come from an intern. 

_Able to learn_ is having the space to take moderate risks, fail, and learn from those failures without the fear of
repercussions. Without this, innovation becomes extremely difficult. Over time, it leads to only a few people driving
the innovation in an organization instead of everyone which hinders the overall innovation in an organziation.

_Safe to contribute_ means that feedback is not feared and is known to be constructive. Positive feedback is actionable.
There is no question on what the behavior is that is leading to a positive impact on the team or in the organization.
Similarly, negative feedback precisely identifies the behavior that is having a negative impact on the larger team and
organization. _Safe to contribute_ means that negative feedback is seen as an opportunity for growth to benefit the
individual as well as the team and organization. It is also providing the space for mutual feedback where feedback is
requested a direct report.

_Safe to challenge the status quo_ is having the space to ask the question of "why do we do it this way?" It is
important to not only train organizational leaders on providing this space, but also the people on the teams themselves.
When a new person joins the team, they are coming in with a fresh and diverse perspective. Most times they are brimming
with energy and want to learn and understand why this organization does something a specific way. The quickest way to
kill that energy is for anyone on the team to say "it's just the way we've always done it and it isn't going to change."

## What role does WHAT & HOW play in psychological safety?

How are WHAT & HOW used to build _inclusion?_ _Inclusion_ is only felt when the person's perspective feels understood.
The only way to do that is to actually understand the perspective and convince the person that you do understand it.
What is the best way of doing that? Exactly like in [WHAT & HOW: Negotiation](./posts/what-how-negotiation) to
understand a counterpart's perspective, we ask WHAT & HOW questions to build our perspective. And then we can go on to
use Mirroring and Labeling (this is another plug to read 
[_Never Split the Difference_](https://www.blackswanltd.com/never-split-the-difference)) to show the person that we do
understand (or find out that we don't in a non-combative way and go back to WHAT & HOW). When I feel like my perspective
is understood, I feel included.

How are WHAT & HOW used to develop the _ability to learn?_ Coaching is one of the most effective ways of teaching;
especially as skillsets diverge. Leading someone to _their_ answer develops critical thinking and makes the answer
stick. If a leader does the critical thinking for them and provides the final answer, it doesn't develop the person. It
also runs the risk of only using the leader's perspective instead of the diverse perspectives of everyone. What does
coaching someone look like? You guessed it! Lots of WHAT & HOW questions while actively listening to the problem and
guiding the other person to find _their_ answer.

How are WHAT & HOW used to create the _saftey to contribute?_ Effective feedback is one of the three core pillars to
developing a team of high performers. Different versions of the 
[SBI framework](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/)
Lara Hogan's take on the SBI framework--the [_Feedback Equation_](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/)-- is an
effective way to deliver feedback, focusing on making the feedback actionable by adding a request at the end. One
example could be: "Can you include more information in your messages so that I can make sure I can fully understand you
upfront?" After getting an affirmation on the request, a WHAT or HOW question can show that the person is supported in
making this change. "HOW can I support you in growing towards this?" or "WHAT can I do to support you in this area?"
This helps build more trust in the relationship. This request is not just a "this needs to change" but is also a "you
are not on your own. There is support to make this change".

How are WHAT & HOW used to create the _saftey to challenge the status quo?_ The ideas behind it being _safe to challenge
the status quo_ is continuous improvement. When "why don't we do it this way?" is asked or when "we need to do it this
way" is stated, the person is pushing for improvement from their perspective. WHAT & HOW become really important tools
in persistently chasing after that other perspective. While in the chase, bringing the ideas of 
[WHAT & HOW in Organizational Leadership](./posts/what-how-organizational-leadership) into the conversation becomes a
powerful teaching tool (for both parties). We might be convinced that we can't actually do what is being suggested, but
through WHAT & HOW questions we discover that we can (we learn something by discovering their perspective). Or maybe we
are headed in that direction but we see a lot of steps that we need to take to get there from where we are today. WHAT &
HOW are amazing tools to help grow strategic thinking skills in the team (they learn something by us communicating our
perspective through WHAT & HOW).

WHAT & HOW are the main tools for effective people development and management of a high performance team. WHAT & HOW
leads to understanding the perspectives of direct reports to provide insights and opportunities for development for
them. It also affords us the opportunity for self-development as we are required to put aside our perspective and learn
about someone else's. They are the main tools that drive building trust on a team through inclusion, learning, feedback
culture, and pushing for continuous improvement.
